"1","Wuthering Heights"," 04, 2013 Chelsea","did not like it"," I ve tried it three times. I know people are obsessed with it. I hate everyone in the book and I just can t care about a book where I actually hate the characters.And, sure, I get the interpretation that as terrible as Heathcliff and Cathy are, it s their love that redeems them, and isn t that romantic.No."
"2","Wuthering Heights"," 27, 2016 K.","it was amazing"," I understand why many people hate this book. Catherine and Heathcliff are monstrous. Monstrous. You won t like them because they are unlikable. They are irrational, self absorbed, malicious and pretty much any negative quality you can think a person is capable of possessing without imploding. They seek and destroy and act with no thought to consequence. And I find it fascinating that Emily Bronte chose them to be her central protagonists.When this was first published it was met with animosity because of how utterly repugnant these two characters were. The way they go about their business caring nothing for others but themselves was enough for me to shake my head in complete and total judgment, as if Catherine and Heathcliff could see me and are then effectively shamed by their actions. Wuthering Heights is epic, in my humble opinion, because I believe that the scope of this story is monumental. Let me explain it is a simple tale between two families that are bound in such a way that their fates are irrevocably linked. What affects one, affects the other. Its about Catherine and Heathcliff who fall in love and how their relationship ruins the lives of those around them. The book, all 400 pages of it, occur almost entirely at Wuthering Heights, the estate of the Earnshaws, and at Thrushcross Grange, the estate of the Lintons with only a couple of miles of land in between.And yet it is not a small story.The emotional magnitude of this book is great and far reaching. The provoking and unapologetic quality of Bronte s writing is seductive. The process of reading this story can feel so masochistic sometimes that its almost if she s daring us to stop reading and throw the book away. Like its a game of personal endurance to see how much we can take, how far we can go. She pushes at us, challenging us and all the while knowing that we have to keep reading because redemption awaits. It is nothing like its contemporaries. The moors, the darkness of the moors, that curses the household of Wuthering Heights and its inhabitants is ever present. Nature is personified. It is its own character its there, lingering and simmering ever so quietly, saturating every scene with its silent threats of doom...okay, I have to stop talking like this...what am I anymore There is poison in this book, but let me ease your mind by saying that it is balanced with goodness also. This isn t a perfect novel. There were still moments I found myself in perplexion recently invented word . And while everything about Catherine and Heathcliff may be corrupt, there is hope in Wuthering Heights. If you can journey through the menacing forest of Emily Bronte s imagination, do it because the view is something to behold.Ha ha ha, this review...what even is this "
"3","Wuthering Heights"," 30, 2007 Larissa","really liked it"," Certain novels come to you with pre packaged expectations. They just seem to be part of literature s collective unconscious, even if they are completely outside of your own cultural referents. I, for instance, who have no particular knowledge of or great love for romantic, Anglo Gothic fiction, came to Wuthering Heights with the assumption that I was picking up a melancholy ghost story of thwarted, passionate love and eternal obsession. Obsession turned out to be only accurate part of this presumption. Having an image of Heathcliff and Cathy embracing Gone with the Wind style on a windy moor ironed in my mind, I was almost completely unprepared for the hermetic, moribund, bleak, vengeful, perverse, and yes obsessive novel that this really is. Don Quixote is not about windmills and Wuthering Heights is not really a love story. Heathcliff and Cathy s love affair if it can be called that is a narcissistic I am Heathcliff Cathy exclaims at one point , possessive, and imminently cruel relationship predicated on self denial and an obsessiveness that relies not on passion, but rather borders on hatred. They are selfish, violent, and contriving people who have borne their fair share of abuses mostly Heathcliff in this respect and in turn, feel no compunction about raining similar abuses on those who they find beneath them.Given this dynamic, it seems perhaps inevitable that these two characters would make not only themselves miserable, but everyone around them miserable even after death. This is particularly easy to accomplish mainly because there are with the exception of Mr. Lockwood, the tenant who rents a home from Heathcliff no outside characters. Everyone in the novel including the servants is isolated, trapped between the same two homes, with the same two families, and have truly no chance of escaping any of the events and repercussions that occur. One character makes a temporary escape, only to suffer all the more for it later. More important, however, is the fact that Heathcliff and Cathy don t even need be present although they usually are in some fashion for their influences to be felt by the other characters. The sins of the father, are literally, inherited and distributed among the next generation. The children of Wuthering Heights are not only physical doubles of their parents At least 3 characters look like Cathy, and one resembles Heathcliff , but they are also spiritual stand ins. They must suffer for past transgressions, and they must find a way to make amends for them. All, I might add, without the particular benefit of ever having the full story, the context that might be necessary to actually change their circumstances. Misery, it seems, is inevitable. There is, of course, much more to be said about this novel. One could spend quite some time dissecting all the various repetitions and doublings, the narrative structure the story is told by the housekeeper to the lodger who then writes it down as a diary entry , or the archetypal analogies and semi biblical symbolism that seems to be implicit to every part of this story. The point being, I suppose, that while Wuthering Heights may not be the wistful romance one or maybe just I expected to be, it is a particularly satisfying one for all of its dark and layered surprises.

"4","Wuthering Heights"," 13, 2016 karen","it was amazing"," all i care about in this goddamn life are me, my drums, and you ...if you don t know that quote, you re probably too young to be reading this and isn t it past your bedtime or shouldn t you be in school or something but that quote, hyper earnest cheese that is romance. wuthering heights is something more dangerous than romance. it s one long protracted retaliation masquerading as passion. and goddamn do i love it. i can t believe i haven t reviewed it before i mention this book in more than half of my reviews, i have a whole shelf devoted to its retellings, so why the delay but better late than never. no, it s not a perfect novel it s a flawed structure revealing the actions of seriously flawed people. the framing device within a framing device totally awkward. having nelly dean tell the story even though where was she for most of the action totally wrong move, bronte it makes the beginning such a slog to get through. but that s just stale loaf the good stuff is all the meat in between. and oh, the meat... the swarthy stranger of mysterious origins being raised in a family of sheltered overmoist english mushrooms, all pale and rain bloated, the running wild, two souls against the world adolescence...childhood indiscretions... vows and tantrums, bonding, unspoken promises, yes i will yes i will yes i will. oh, but wait, what s this ...it s blond and it s rich and it s whats expected of me. very well then. see ya, heathcliff...it s just textbook gothic from here on out revenge seduction, overheard conversations, mysterious disappearances, murdered puppies, swooning, vindictive child rearing, death, ghosts, moors, phoar... but this to me, is a perfect love story, even though it s more like torture. the unattainable is always more romantic than the storybook. i don t like an uncomplicated ending, and a story is more impactful with nuanced characters, preferably heavily unlikeable throughout. this is where i plug head on one of my favorite movies ever. do it. this story just makes me feel good. and i m well over my teenage fascination with the bad boy i realized pretty quick that bad boys are usually pretty dumb. so i moved on to emotionally disturbed , which is the same thing, really plenty of drama, and they will leave you drunken presents on your lawn road signs, carousel ponies.. , but not complete burnouts, at least. but my teenaged dating pool is neither here nor there, the point is that heathcliff can be romanticized as this victim villain without having to correspond to the ideal. it s about the level of passion, the size of the grand romantic gesture. devoting your life to destroying the people who kept you from your true love is an amazingly grand gesture. "
"5","Wuthering Heights"," 02, 2008 Ellen","did not like it"," I never expected this book to be as flagrantly, unforgivably bad as it was.To start, Bronte s technical choice of narrating the story of the primary characters by having the housekeeper explain everything to a tenant 20 years after it happened completely kills suspense and intimacy. The most I can say is that to some extent this functions as a device to help shroud the story and motives from the reader. But really, at the time literary technique hadn t quite always gotten around to accepting that omnipotent 3rd person narrators are allowed, so you d have to have a multiperspective story told by an omnipotent 3rd person narrator who was actually a character in the story e.g. the housekeeper Ellen . The layers of perspective make it annoying and sometimes impossible to figure out who is telling what bit of story and moreover, because so much is related as two characters explaining things between themselves, the result is that we rarely see any action, and instead have the entire book explained in socratic, pedantic exposition.The sense of place is poorly rendered and almost entirely missing. Great, the moor is gray.But ultimately, the most damning thing is that the characters are a bunch of immature, insuffrable, narcissistic assholes with very little self respect. This isn t a story of great love and passion. It s the story of how child abuse perpetuates itself through the generations. The characters are either emotionally abused as children or, as in the case of Cathy I, they re spoiled and overindulged with no discipline and can t muster the restraint and self respect to ditch abusive relationships. I kept waiting for any of the characters to be remotely worth my time, but I found no respite from the brutish abuse of the horribly twisted Heathcliff or from the simpering idiocy of Cathy I and II. Ugh. Not only are there no transformations or growth, but the characters aren t even that likable to begin with. How this book got to be a classic is beyond me. "
"6","Wuthering Heights"," 17, 2015 Emily May","it was amazing"," This is my favourite book. I do not say that lightly, I ve read quite a lot from all different genres and time periods, but this is my favourite book. Of all time. Ever. The ladies over at The Readventurer kindly allowed me to get my feelings of utter adoration for Wuthering Heights off my chest in their Year of the Classics feature, but I now realise it s time I posted a little something in this blank review space. I mean, come on, it s my favourite book so it deserves better than empty nothingness.So, what do I love so much about Wuthering Heights Everything. Okay, maybe not, that wouldn t really be saying it strongly enough.What I love about this novel is the setting, the wilderness. This is not a story about niceties and upper class propriety, this is the tale of people who aren t so socially acceptable, who live away from the strict rules of civilization it s almost as if they re not quite from the world we know. The isolation of the setting out on the Yorkshire moors between the fictional dwellings of The Heights and Thrushcross Grange emphasises how far removed these characters are from social norms, how unconventional they are, and how lonely they are.This is a novel for readers who can appreciate unlikeable characters, readers who don t have to like someone to achieve a certain level of understanding them and their circumstances. People are not born evil... so what makes them that way What torments a man so much that he refuses to believe he has any worth What kind of person digs up the grave of their loved one so they can see them once again Heathcliff was not created to be liked or to earn your forgiveness, Emily Bront simply tells his story from the abusive and unloved childhood he endured, to his obsession with the only person alive who showed him any real kindness, to his adulthood as an angry, violent man who beats his wife and imprisons the younger Cathy in order to make her marry his son.It would be so easy to hate Heathcliff, and I don t feel that he is some dark, sexy hero like others often do. But I appreciate what Emily Bront attempts to teach us about the cycle of violence and aggression. Heathcliff eventually becomes little more than the man he hates, by being brought up with beatings and anger he in turn unleashes it on everyone else. And Cathy is no delicate flower either. What hope did Heathcliff have when the only person he ever loved was a selfish, vindictive, little wretch But I love Emily Bront for creating such imperfect, screwed up characters.This is a dark novel that deals with some very complicated individuals, but I think in the end we are offered the possibility of peace and happiness through Cathy younger and Hareton s relationship, and the suggestion that Cathy older and Heathcliff were reunited in the afterlife. I had an English teacher in high school that said Cathy and Heathcliff s personalities and their relationship were too much for this world and that peace was only possible for them in the next. I have no idea if this was something Ms Bronte intended, but the romantic in me likes to imagine that it s true. "
"7","Wuthering Heights"," 15, 2009 Eliszard","liked it"," Ah the classics. Everybody can read their own agenda in them. So, first a short plot guide for dinner conversations when one needs to fake acculturation, and then on to the critics view.

"8","Wuthering Heights"," 25, 2014 Jake","it was amazing"," I first read this in AP English Literature senior year of high school. This book is dense and thick and confusing, and with a class full of haters, it was hard to wrap my head around it. I subsequently read it three or four more times for classes in college and every time I read it, I loved it more. I always found some new, fascinating piece of the story I had never picked up on.The last time I read it, I suddenly realized that there were many hints and clues that Heathcliff could, in fact, be black. A quick shot at research into Liverpool, where Mr. Earnshaw found the urchin, shows that it was the home to a thriving slave trade. This theory completely changes the story, in my opinion.Or the thought someone brought up in our seminar on the Brontes what if Nellie is in love with Heathcliff and subsequently altered how she told the story You do find Nellie to be coincidently involved in many key scenes throughout the text. What if she isn t the good guy most readers assume she is Wuthering Heights is one of the quintessential novels in history. There s nothing else you can really say about it, except that it s one of the best pieces of writing to ever be created. It s just that incredible.Finished for the 5th time 11 25 2014 "
"9","Wuthering Heights"," 07, 2008 Kellie","did not like it"," I read this book for my AP Literature class. I loved the teacher, loved the subject matter, and loved pretty much everything else we had read, so I had high hopes for this book. I must say, I made a genuine and sincere effort to like this book, I really did. I got half way through with no hope in sight, yet I perservered, hoping the second half would show promise in the next generation. No such luck. Although nothing tops the finale love scene between Heathcliff and Katherine, with Heathcliff foaming at the mouth and a verbal battle of no, YOU killed me no, you killed yourself a stupidity hiterto unknown since the no YOU RE prettier battles . Eventually, the final pages came into view and I was desperate there must be some redemption for this junk Some message, some ending sequence, SOMETHING that makes this worthwhile. The characters are so self absorbed and posses an unprecendeted lack of intelligence, yet are still portrayed as intelligent by the literary world, that it seemed like the only fitting ending would be the characters realizing their stupidity and engaging in a mass suicide. No such luck. Every last word was idiotic and as empty as the first. But you know what grinds my gears even more than the fact that I wasted a week on this worthless pseudo classic It kills me that people not only mistake this hoax for real literature, but reference it for ROMANTIC value Foaming at the mouth, marrying someone you don t love, wow.... now that s a level of romance lovers fantasize about achieving.

"10","Wuthering Heights"," 21, 2007 Jackie the Librarian","did not like it"," If you think that spitefulness is romantic, and that people destroying their lives is dramatic, go ahead and read this book. But don t say I didn t warn you."
"11","Wuthering Heights"," 19, 2016","it was amazing"," .. .. . . . . . .. "
"12","Wuthering Heights"," 26, 2016 Bookworm Sean","it was ok"," This is a review I never imagined I d write. This is a book I was convinced I d love. I just have to face the facts, Emily is no Charlotte.I m going to start with the positives. The characterisation of Heathcliff is incredibly strong. He is a man who is utterly tormented by the world. As a gypsy boy he is dark skinned and dark haired, and to the English this rough, almost wild, look makes him a ruffian. He stands up for himself, and bites back thus, he is termed a monster. In a very, very, Frankenstein s monster like sense, his perceived outer image begins to permeate his soul. Call a man a monster, and eventually he may start acting like one. He s not a rough diamond a pearl containing oyster of a rustic he s a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man. He is a very complex man, capable of great cruelty and kindness. The world has made him bitter, and in a way ruined him. He reaps revenge, but revenge always ends the same way it doesn t solve problems but creates more. So he becomes even more tormented, this time by his own actions. He is very Byronic, and by today s standards a little bit of a bad boy. He has all the standard tropes of an anti hero, one that becomes a figure that can be sympathised with and hated. He s a very complex man. The Bronte s were directly affected by Byron s poetry. Rochester is Charlotte s portrayal of a similar, albeit less vengeful, character. Love is the key torment in both works. Heathcliff has been rejected, as Rochester cannot open his heart because of his secret wife. But, rather that overcome his personal loss, and subject the world to his dark and broody personality, Heathcliff actually seeks to do others harm. He is a very sensitive man when it comes to his own emotions, though he lacks any real empathy. He does not care that he is creating more pain for others. He spends his life spreading more hate into the world. His only redeeming quality is his love for Catherine, but that doesn t excuse his tyranny. He knows how nasty he is She abandoned her home under a delusion, he answered, picturing in me a hero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion. I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature, so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character and acting on the false impressions she cherished. He s so self centred So I rather like his character, well not like but appreciate the complexity, though the novel s structure itself was abysmal. I have quite a few problems with the narrative.Why is a servant telling us this story as she speaks to a visitor of her master s house Why are we hearing someone s interpretation of the events rather than the events themselves Why is it twenty years later in the form of an extremely long conversation Why is the servant still actually working for Heathcliff She would have left. Nobody would choose to work for such a man. It just doesn t make a lot of sense. At times it felt like the credibility of the story was stretched to breaking point. Nelly the servant actually being in some of the scenes was almost laughable. Often it was followed by a terrible explanation attempting to justify her presence. It sounded very desperate to me. This leads perfectly on to my next point. Half way through the story the start of volume ii we are told that the conversation has ended. We then hear the visitor s description of the servant s narrative about Heathcliff s life. I mean seriously So there are three layers of storytelling. Isn t that completely unnecessary and overcomplicated Why not just have Heathcliff tell the story or at the very least have the servant tell the story from start to finish in one story arc with no time shifts. For me, it felt like Emily wrote herself into a corner with her choice of narrative and desperately tried to write herself out of it to the point of ridiculousness. How much of the story can we believe How much bias is in the narratives Then there was the dialogue overloads. Large parts of the novel were entirely conversational. The narration was minimalistic and bare. The only character whose thoughts we were privy to, again Nelly the servant, was completely irrelevant to the plot. Who cares about the servant s emotion and reactions This isn t her story thus, the dialogue was packed out to the point of unnaturalness to fit in the thoughts of characters whose minds we weren t privy to. Simply put, the characters said thing people wouldn t realistically say in conversation. It was overflowing with emotions and private thoughts. It was awkward. I m not talking about private conversations, those don t happen as Nelly is awkwardly present for every single event, but announcements or decisions that should be internal announced to a group of people. This is why plays have asides and soliloquies. And this is why novels aren t told from the perspective of a random servant. There is clearly a great story here. Plot wise the novel is wonderful. But the way in which Emily told her story was nothing short of disastrous. It felt like a wasted opportunity. I m absolutely horrified at how poor it is. This novel needed to be taken apart, re wrote, and put back together again. Perhaps then it would have been worthy of the story it failed to tell. I ve never been so massively underwhelmed in such a blatant lack of skill in a canonised piece of literature, one that has immense critical reception. Someone please tell me, what did I miss I will be reading this again later this year it s on my university module so I will have to familiarise myself with it once more before my lessons. I m not overly looking forward to it, but perhaps then my tutors will shed light on to why this is such a revered novel beyond that of a romantic version of an anti hero. But, for me, the structure and the way it was written were just terrible. I need more than a poorly told plot to enjoy a piece of literarue. I thought I d also mention Emily s poetry. I ve been reading through her collected works, and, I must say, I think she is a much better poet than a novelist. I admire some of her poetical works greatly. "
"13","Wuthering Heights"," 13, 2010 Madeline","did not like it"," If you ve been following my status updates as I read this book, you can probably guess what kind of review this is going to be. answer the best kind So let s get the good stuff out of the way first, and then I can start the ranting. Good stuff I liked some of the characters. Ellen was sweet, and seemed to be the only sensible person in the story. And lord, does she get put through a lot of shit. Girlfriend needs a hug and a spa weekend after all she s been through. I also liked Catherine II and Hareton unlike their romantic predecessors and believe me, we ll get to those two soon , they were likeable most of the time. Sure, they had their jackass moments, but considering their respective upbringings, can you really blame them Also, they reminded me of Bender and Claire from The Breakfast Club. Like I said, kind of irritating and stupid, but sweet. I also appreciated the incredible passion of the story and the passionate emotions it raised in me Sure, I hated Heathcliff, but even I swooned a little during his final scene with Cathy. Sure, Emily Bronte has written the most terrifying portrayal of a love story I ve ever seen Fatal Attraction Pfft. , but she did it really, really well. Terrifying as it is. Which brings me to the next section of this review...Bad Stuff I cannot, for the life of me, understand why anyone thinks this is a love story. It s a horror story of love and passion gone horribly, horribly wrong, and Heathcliff is one of the greatest villains ever created in literature. Notice I said villain and not antihero. Heathcliff is not an antihero. He is a sociopath, and for the last fifty pages of the story I wanted to violently murder him so badly that my hands were shaking as I held the book. He is evil. Cathy doesn t get my sympathy, either. She was a spoiled, unfeeling bitch during every moment she was present in the story, and it s only because she was dead by page 200 that she didn t make me as angry as Heathcliff did she simply didn t have enough time. But let s get back to Heathcliff I cannot outline here all of the evil things he did over the course of the story, and to do so would probably be to give away spoilers. Let me just say this I now understand completely why Wuthering Heights is being advertised in bookstores as Bella and Edwards Favorite Book . It should be. As I said in a comment on one of my statuses Edward Cullen is good, but Heathcliff wrote the fucking book on Domestic Abuse Thinly Disguised As Love. I don t know why so many readers get all fangirly over Heathcliff. He s an asshole, a sociopath, and even he knows how evil he is. As he says of Isabella, a girl he marries and then treats so horribly I can t even talk about it right now She abandoned them under a delusion...picturing in me a hero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion. I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature, so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character, and acting on the false impression she has cherished. Hear that, Heathcliff fangirls Even he thinks you re all morons for liking him. And, just to end this on a good note I ve shared this webcomic before, but it fits here too because, let s face it, the Bronte sisters had terrible taste in men. "
"14","Wuthering Heights"," 08, 2013 Nataliya","liked it"," Not often do I decide to edit the review and change the opinion of the book I initially detested mere days after writing a why I hated it opus. Emily Bronte, you mastermind In addition to learning truly horrifying things through the comments from my fellow lovely Goodreaders people have told me that not only Heathcliff and Catherine s horrible story served as an inspiration for Twilight a story that s paraded as a love story and brrrr that in almost all polls on most romantic literary figure, Heathcliff takes the lead I read this comment from Teresa I think I read somewhere maybe in this book Emily Bronte The Artist As a Free Woman that she was creating her own world and the book does seem claustrophobic with its two framing narrators , her own mythos. If one sees that interpretation, I think Heathcliff could be viewed almost as a Zeus figure, another petty and vengeful entity. ... a comment that, combined with her observation in another comment that the names Hindley Heathcliff Hareton all started with the same letter, not to mention having two Catherines an enclosed world that repeated itself led me to realize that yes, in a mind blowing turn of events this book is a genius take on the completely secluded, isolated world that lives only by its own rules, ruled by its own godlike creatures, and bears little resemblance to and has little influence from the larger universe outside of it. Two Catherines in this book and both of them take a journey between the stops of Catherine Earnshaw , Catherine Heathcliff and Catherine Linton because what other options do they have Even young Cathy, so seemingly close to possibly leaving this enclosed corner of the universe thanks to sudden fascination Lockwood a man of the outside world takes to her, ultimately remains tightly tethered to the place she knows, remaining with an Earnshaw her first cousin because who else is there Heathcliff, who could have had the world, comes back to rule the little universe into which he was adopted, unable to leave the country of grey moors.And everyone else is a Linton another link in the chain that connects everyone else. And the little world of this novel takes no one else in who is not a Linton, a Cathy or an incarnation of Heathcliff Hareton Hindley. Everyone stays together, their fates tied only to one another, with disregard to the world outside. Only Isabella who never seems to have fit into this world anyway manages to escape but remains tethered to this world by her child, Linton Heathcliff, who thanks to his names is powerless to escape being sucked into this little corner of the universe and become a pathetic little villain.And this world, free from the influence outside, just continues to go in its own little circle, being its own little and terrifying universe.Ok, mindblowing. Enough to up my star rating by a full star. Emily Bronte, your mind was darker than I gave it credit for. Touch . ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM LONG AGO a.k.a. a few days an eternity in the eyes of a fruitfly, however Ok, I ll be honest I decided to read this one really because the word Wuthering had for a while been fascinating my non native speaker brain Basically, brain insists it should be wIthering. Computer spellcheck agrees. And both of them are wrong. Plus, I have also been introduced to it by of course pop culture, courtesy of Phoebe Buffay In the remainder of this episode, Rachel ends up comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop , to Phoebe s utmost delight. Ok, back to serious now.This book had one of the most promising beginnings in all the literature. No joke. The narrator s stumbling into Heathcliff s household leads to the opening chapter as surreal and creepy as a nightmare you really want to wake up from but cannot. Seriously, let s look back to the beginning of the tale with Heathcliff, and the dogs, and the creepiest servant since Igor, and strange perplexing characters of Hareton and Cathy, all in the most gothic setting a 19th century mind could have conjured. Lovely, just lovely.But then a meddling self righteous servant sat down to tell the story of Cathy and Heathcliff and everyone else caught in the destructive hurricane those two left in their selfish wake and something changed, the magic dissolved. I was promised passion and wilderness. Instead I got a cold wearisome shower of egotistical, self absorbed, shallow, destructive, prejudiced, reckless petty disregard for anyone else from everyone else, combined with clear cases of sociopathic, narcissistic, and spoiled to the core people damaging everything they come in contact with. It s not wild passion it s self absorbed selfishness and nothing more. It s a spoiled brat in a grocery store flinging himself on the floor and throwing a raging, embarrassing tantrum because he just has to have that unnecessary piece of candy. No, I m not a fan of anger, revenge and possessiveness trying to masquerade as wild love and passion. Neither Catherine nor Heathcliff love one another instead of love they might as well just selfishly scream, WAAAAAANT Heathcliff is not wild he is a cruel sociopath. Catherine is not wild and passionate she is a haughty and spoiled thoughtless creature.And I cannot help asking, dear reader What is the point Yes, I understand the balls ovaries needed for making such repulsive personalities be the center of your story actually, that s not just Cathy and Heathcliff being repugnant think of Hindley, and Hareton, and brrrr Joseph, and young Linton, and even young Cathy, and to a point the ever meddling self righteous unsure where her allegiance lies but probably with whoever the current master happens to be Nelly Dean , and to systematically beat out any possible feel good moment in this book. It probably was not an easy book to write, and definitely is not an easy book to read.But because of all that I could not bring myself to care in the least. What s worse, the little cringeworthy details peppered throughout the story became even more obvious in the light of me disliking the book Like the constant neverending out of character moments that all the action here seems to hinge upon Heathcliff s sudden madness death Catherine s reaction to the argument between Heathcliff and Edgar Cathy and Hareton s sudden feelings for each other to name a few . Contrived happy ish ending a thought that young Cathy will end up with a man who has physically assaulted her in the past and be happy with him in a Stockholm Syndrome like fashion and for it a to seem like a good choice and b the violence presented as something she had coming for daring to have a saucy tongue. Actually, constant violence, threats, marital rape the stuff that would make even George R.R. Martin seem like a tender hearted softie. Constant reminders of darkness of Heathcliff s character being tied to the darkness of his skin while white paleness of the Lintons provides a contrast of civilization to the brute. Dark skin evil, right Ah, Miss Bronte, really Constant nervous outbreaks and the destructive passion of feelings that after a while became much too repetitive. The predictable cycle of Heathcliff or Catherine wanting something rudeness physical violence to those they perceive to be their inferiors some contrived disease brought on by nervous exhaustion or something of the sort someone probably dies for no reason than the effects of wild passions rinse, repeat. Joseph s dialect. Need I say more And, all throughout, I realized that I just could no longer care about the story that brought two English families living on the wild moors to the state that the narrator observes in such a promising beginning of this book. I think I was too exhausted with this story to care. It tried too hard to unapologetically be dark and brooding and bleak and succeeded in just wearing me out. 2 stars and valiant attempts to dodge the shower of rotten eggs and rotten tomatoes heading my way.

"15","Wuthering Heights"," 13, 2016 Vessey","it was amazing"," SPOILERS I am Heathcliff he s always, always in my mind not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself but as my own being. Passion. Desire. Love. Are they the same thing If we are so intoxicated by someone as ending up seeing them as a mirror to our own self, is this love It is. Sometimes. But sometimes it is sign not of devotion, but of egotism so strong that it stops us from seeing the actual person and we imagine a likeness that isn t there just in order to fulfill our needs. I believe that Catherine loves Heathcliff, but I don t believe she understands him or desires to. By believing he would agree to her plan she shows how little she takes into account what he actually is. She is so lost in her passion that she isn t willing to admit the difference between them. It is a dangerous thing to be so absorbed by passion for someone that you don t even care to understand and accept them for who they are. You just want to own them. By making the choice of marrying another man and keeping Heathcliff by her side as a lover whom she would support with her husband s money she gives up on the very thing that has connected them so far, on the very thing that has stood at the core of their love. Freedom. They both grow up as captives of society that does not understand and accept them for who they are. He is the only one in front of whom she can be herself and she is the only one in front of whom he can be himself. But by choosing to dissemble and submit, Catherine loses that spark that initially connects them. She believes it is for their own good. He is heartbroken. When he comes back, he spends so much time and energy trying to bring back a girl who no longer exists. He cannot stand the woman she has turned herself into. In this case, is he still in love with her or merely in the memory of her When the person we have loved loses the part that has held our affections, when should we give up on them and when should we devote ourselves to restoring that part He s more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same. Their tragedy lies exactly in the fact that they are not the same. He wants freedom, she wants security. Benjamin Franklin says Those who surrender freedom for security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one. I neither agree, nor disagree. I believe it is a very subjective matter. It isn t that simple. But in the case of Catherine it really does turn out this way. In the end she has neither comfort, nor freedom.How much do we know those who we claim to love We all risk to see something that isn t actually there or miss something that is. Either blinded by passion or by our desire to recreate the objects of our passion. If we cannot truly accept our loved ones for who they are and we try to change them, then do we truly love them or simply those we would like them to be Can such a distinction be made Or is it a little bit of both Do we love only those parts of our partners that resemble ourselves or are we willing to love even those we cannot accept Are love and acceptance the same thing It isn t uncommon for a person to try changing their loved one, but sometimes the good and the bad come from the same place and if we happen to succeed, we are at risk of destroying the good as well. Catherine tries to tame Heathcliff and in doing so, she destroys him. His passionate love turns into passionate hatred.Feeling so close to someone as not to know where you end and they begin is either a sign of profound affinity or a profound delusion. Love is merciful and cruel, generous and selfish, sorrow and ecstasy. We all lose something and gain something by choosing to give into another person. Change is inevitable. Sometimes we get stronger, sometimes we are ruined. Sometimes it is a little bit of both. Some of us find their worthy partners, some, sadly, never do. But I believe that no matter on which side of the coin you turn out, staying faithful to yourself is always the right choice. "
"16","Wuthering Heights"," 16, 2015 Samadrita","it was amazing"," It is a testament to the overabundance of cliches clogging the realms of literature featuring romance, that readers widely associate the middle Bront sister s tour de force with vindictive fury, abuse and emotional excesses rather than love. Because bestowing approval on an unnatural, obsessive love that devoured everything in its vicinity out of pure malice somehow throws our moral compass into a tizzy.Last time I read this, Emily Bront had cruelly crushed a child s enjoyment of a book much like Heathcliff remorselessly causes the universe stretching between the extremities of Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights to implode violently. She had sucked me into a vortex of dark, inchoate feelings for a week or so from which I found difficult to extricate myself. But this time The pages flew by. My spirit soared every time Bront breached a boundary of what the voices in favor of the status quo label propriety, demolished a stereotype, let her heroine roam the outdoors as freely as she could with the one person who never sought to reduce her individuality to a compilation of feminine attributes. And the romance It made me swoon. So pardon me if I shun those patriarchy approved alpha males who infantilize their lovers, their false sheen of dignity and restraint, the promise of domesticated happily ever afters, and righteous, unidimensional do gooders. I crave for Emily s brutal candour instead, her courageous glorification of this earth shattering, all consuming desire to melt, to unite with the one you covet, with nary a care for what it may entail. The love that heats up your blood and is food for your soul and percolates every fibre of your being. But, Heathcliff, if I dare you now, will you venture If you do, I ll keep you. I ll not lie there by myself they may bury me twelve feet deep, and throw the church down over me, but I won t rest till you are with me. I never will Heathcliff and Catherine s relationship was beyond their own control and comprehension, a storm which wreaked havoc in the lives of those who sought to throttle it, a force of nature which subsided only when both its initiators were reconciled in death free to resume their wild, unchecked peregrinations across the stretch of earth which they claimed as their very own the moors, which divorced from worldly considerations of wars, Empire and inequality, became the only utopia which could accommodate their calamitous passion for each other. I cannot look down to this floor, but her features are shaped in the flags In every cloud, in every tree filling the air at night, and caught by glimpses in every object by day I am surrounded with her image Sartre in his preface passionate endorsement to Frantz Fanon s The Wretched of the Earth says ...he shows perfectly clearly that this irrepressible violence is neither a storm in a teacup nor the reemergence of savage instincts nor even a consequence of resentment it is man restructuring himself. And that s as concise and succinct a defense I can provide for Heathcliff, his rage that won t be quelled and its devastating manifestations. The Heathcliff without a second name, the perpetual outsider in a white washed society breeding manifold evils, the other, the thing which Nelly Dean, Mrs Earnshaw, Hindley and even the infant Catherine see as nothing other than a dirty, smelly, baseborn creature deserving of contempt. A person of color stranded in a world increasingly being cleaved into virulent polarities of light and dark, Occident and Orient, powerful and powerless, colonizer and colonized, white master and black slave, abuser and abused. Violence is the language of the oppressed after all, especially because the oppressor teaches him no better. I wish I had light hair and a fair skin, and was dressed and behaved as well, and had a chance of being as rich as he will be And Catherine I disagree with Simone de Beauvoir when she asserts She uses his words, she repeats his gestures, adopts his manias and tics. I am Heathcliff, says Catherine in Wuthering Heights this is the cry of all women in love she is another incarnation of the beloved, his reflection, his double she is he. She lets her own world flounder in contingence she lives in his universe. This certainly typifies heroines populating the wide spectrum of conventional romance novels in general. But I consider Catherine exempt from this pigeonholing. A few moments from her death she contemplates reverting to her sexless girlhood to be reunited with a childhood companion only with whom she had savoured true liberty, to travel back to a time when societal mores hadn t impressed upon her a catastrophic urge for conformity. And if Catherine finds herself to be interchangeable from her other half, then Heathcliff, too, wills himself to dissolve with her into the embrace of the earth which does not discriminate between the baptized and the heathen. ...I dreamt I was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper, with my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers. And if she had been dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you have dreamt of then I said. Of dissolving with her, and being more happy still he answered. There. If Catherine is Heathcliff, then Heathcliff, too, is Catherine. Beings seeking to overturn the societal injunction against their individuation and find their salvation in each other. A salvation they could attain only when Emily ushers in the element of the paranormal, the much vilified, belittled gothic . So take away your insidious Rochesters and sanctimonious Jane Eyres and gentrified romances put on a pedestal. Give me Heathcliff and Catherine instead. Give me their petulant anger, their restlessness and their feral love. "
"17","Wuthering Heights"," 30, 2015 Renato Magalh es Rocha","really liked it"," I approached this book expecting to read about a beautiful and tragic love story instead, I came across an intensive hate story, a revenge tale but love was nowhere to be found. Actually, let me state this better there was love at first... but it was the mere beginning, the catalyst. Love was there only to encompass all the hatred, to imprison it. It was not love itself, but solely a small and transparent bottle with a beautiful love inscription engraved on it in a lovely calligraphy with hearts and flowers decorating it , and once love was thrown away and fell to the floor, it broke, and its content hate itself was set free like a dark red smoke spreading slowly but surely, like a poison or a curse, intoxicating those around who dared to breathe.Emily Bront was very masterful in her writing by using shifts in time through flashbacks and different and unreliable narrators to tell the story of the Earnshaws and Lintons. The book begins in 1801, when a man called Lockwood rents a house known as Thrushcross Grange from a weatlhy man named Heathcliff, who in turn lives in the Wuthering Heights. While paying his landlord a visit, Lockwood is forced to spend his first night there due to a snow storm and, while in his designated bedroom, his attention is grabbed by the name Catherine that s written in many books that are just sitting around. Too affected by her diary entries on those books and the whole dark atmosphere of the Wuthering Heights, he ends up having a nightmare with a girl named Catherine waking up scared, he screams until Heathcliffe barges into the bedroom to see what the fuss is all about and what follows is a very impressive scene. In the morning, Lockwood finally left to the Thrushcross Grange where he met Nelly Dean, the housekeeper who s been in the family for decades. Still not sure that what he saw was just a dream, he asks her about Catherine and Nelly starts to tell him her account of the events.Back in 1771, Mr. Earnshaw father of Hindley and Catherine comes back from a trip bringing home Heathcliff a dark skinned gypsy in aspect whom he decides to adopt. He then becomes Catherine s best friend over the years. Almost ten years later, Heathcliff overhears Catherine saying that it would be degrading to marry him and that she was going to marry neighbor Edgar Linton instead. Deciding to escape and run away, Heathcliff is absent for three years and comes back rich and powerful with a plan of a vengeance to be the sole tormentor of both Earnshaw and Linton families not only for one, but for two generations.It s known that Emily Bront and her sisters started exercising their imagination as children by playing with some wooden soldiers for which they created stories. Wuthering Heights was written in her late twenties, but the novel still carried an atmosphere of little soldiers being toyed with inside of a small box. Like them, Emily s characters seemed to live isolated in a gloomy and dark box almost like an experiment where it was unlikely that they wouldn t become a product of that unsettling environment and impossible that their emotions and feelings wouldn t be taken to extremes making everything turn into matters of life and death.Like Emma and Madame Bovary novels from the same period I had a hard time feeling sympathy for the story s protagonists, especially the main couple as Heathcliff was too bitter and hateful towards everyone, and Catherine as she chose another man to marry, not the one that she really loved not that there s anything wrong with considering status and reputation while deciding on whom to marry but, as far as love stories go, it was difficult to care for both of them well, not only for them it seems not even one character was truly likeable. However, the young Catherine Cathy Linton is an amazing, vivid character. I kept expecting her to jump out of the pages in this case, out of my Kindle and start running around in my living room and flipping through the pages of my books.It was precisely through the spirited Cathy and Hareton, her cousin that the author inserted some hope into her story. Destined to repeat the fate of the previous generation, they ended up breaking Heathcliff s revenge ties and found some comfort and love in each other when it seemed all matters were lost. Had the Bront sister not died so soon after publishing her biggest accomplishment in writing, maybe then she would have written a true love story that of Cathy and Hareton.Rating I was torn between 3 and 4 stars while deciding on my rating for this book. I ended up going with 4 as I enjoyed Emily s prose very much and I think she excelled in writing characters with such conflicting and interesting human s emotions, even though I wouldn t take them with me to my toys box.

So does one of my dearest writer friends. Sorry, ladies it made me want to barf. I understand the attraction, I do. The idea of being immersed in this world of secrets and following the dark, twisted lives of the stupid passionate characters can be incredibly appealing. Sadly, I did not feel the appeal. I only felt this intense black hatred toward every single one of the insipid, selfish characters and basically, the whole thing was a hot mess of the worst kind. A truly skilled author can make even the most irredeemable character likable sadly, I could not muster a scrap of empathy for any of them. There was not one part of me that, upon finishing this book, did not wish I hadn t bothered. Yes, I read this voluntarily. Yes, my mother encouraged that I do so. Yes, I delivered this pile of paper back at her when I was done with an ominous whisper of, Book club will not be resuming next week. Thank you for your time. Usually I love a good classic classic in quotations because some of the books people claim to be classics are just literary bile , but this was something else. Torture, yes. Sorry, Ms. Bronte. I hate your book. No offense. "
"19","Wuthering Heights"," 28, 2016 Henry Avila","it was amazing"," Cathy and Heathcliff, a love story At the beginning of our narrative Mr.Lockwood, a tenant of Thrushcross Grange, visits his landlord Mr.Heathcliff, at Wuthering Heights, four long miles away, across the cold, eerie, moors, people back then walked a great distance, they had few options, without much complaining, troubled Lockwood, wants to get away from society he came to the right place . The setting is northern England, 1801, in the Yorkshire Moors, a vast, remote, desolate, and gloomy grassland, beautiful and ugly at the same time, a haunting locale.

Later he learns the story of his landlord s tragic life, through Mrs.Nelly Dean, his servant at Thrushcross Grange, for three generations there, she tells him about the life of Heathcliff, found in the streets of Liverpool, hungry , crying, dirty, all alone, without anyone caring, at the tender age of two, but the compassionate Mr.Earnshaw, a wealthy man , Catherine s Cathy s father and takes him home.

"21","Wuthering Heights"," 22, 2012 Whitaker","it was amazing"," My goodness, but doesn t Emily Bront get to have her cake and eat it too. On the one hand, the story is underpinned by deeply bourgeois morals on the other hand, she gets to flirt with wildness and nature. It s like going on a luxury safari you get to pretend you re out in the wild but it s wilderness with a champagne breakfast and air conditioned tents. Here you have Heathcliff, right, the stand in for the forces of nature. And this is nature red in tooth and claw , Hearne the Huntsman, the faery changeling that usurps the place of the son. Like all good faeries, Heathcliff upends the natural order good is made bad, the low are made high, love is made indistinguishable from hate. He ousts the gentry out of their hearth and home and becomes lord of the manor, and the world is turned topsy turvy. But in the end, he is defeated. The changeling is ejected, and the land reverts back to the gentry again as both the Grange and Wuthering Heights revert to the care and custody of the Lintons and the Earnshaws. The unity of Catherine and Hindley, the bond of brother and sister that was broken with Heathcliff s arrival, is restored with the marriage of Hareton Earnshaw and Catherine Linton. Chaos and disorder are cast out, and the rightful order of nature is restored. And how huge a role blood plays in this. You can t escape your natural destiny A gentleman will always be a gentleman regardless of how much you try to corrupt him, while the scion of a nameless urchin will be low and nasty regardless of how much gilt he is covered with. You could read the entire Shakespearean canon into this. It s Macbeth, King Lear, The Tempest, and A Midsummer Night s Dream all rolled into one. And yet, oh, the language That deep love, and also terror, of the wild harsh beauty of the moors that sings out in her prose despite her eventual return to civilisation The whole story trembles on this pivot between longing and repulsion. And right to the final word, she never quite resolves it the ambiguity thrums to the very last. Wow "
"22","Wuthering Heights"," 30, 2015 Aubrey","it was amazing"," ...I tell you, I have nearly attained my heaven and that of others is altogether unvalued and uncoveted by me Perhaps it is because I have my nice and neat two years previous effort staring me in the face, but I find it difficult to settle on a catalyzing shade of feeling for this piece of now. Another possibility is, after reading this first in hate, second in love, third in awe in all the blissful horror of that ancient word , further explication to myself of the qualities of this work seems superfluous. There are many, of course, who would disagree, but my interest in convincing others after having been utterly so has waned over the years, filled up with more care for my own development. Besides, this work is a classic. My pleasure at watching it claim that title again, again, and again knows no bounds.The reading populace has such a naive view of what an abusive childhood entails. It takes the nice, comfortable modus operandi of ethics and renders sum zero everything that does not save. Aspects such as gender, skin color, proximity to possible escape routes of the social climbing variety, all become an adaptation at the moment necessity arises. In place of hate there is endurance, in place of friendship there is utilization, in place of love there is solidarity. Adulthood being what it is, the question of one ever reforming is rhetorical at best, stigmatized at worst power being it what it is, it is no wonder most of this work s audience focus on Heathcliff and Catherine rather than Edgar, Mrs. Earnshaw, Hindley. Anyone who faults another for marrying for the sake of money in capitalistic society is a liar and a fool, especially when killing for the sake of the same is so widely accepted.One Lockwood is an unreliable narrator. Two Nelly Dean is unreliable in both narrator and character, a pedagogical taste for controlling communication and a devil s advocate romanticism when it comes to other people s lives. Three Lockwood violated Catherine s confidence by reading her private journal of future planning, and thereby suffers for it. Four we, the readers, are violating Lockwood s confidnce by reading his private journal of wishful thinking. Five The second generation lived out the foundered desires of the stronger of the first, and they will be haunted for it.We have violated this text, and we will reap accordingly.I have to wonder what Emily Bront would have made of the stage. The perspectives, the costs, the interweaving of one s transcribing of another s translation, the brief and inexorable nature of the scenes with their conflicts of duties and susceptibilities and pride, all laid large in the power of their subtle insinuations, their all is not what it seems. The might makes right democracy of Wuthering Heights, the eugenics deathtrap of Thrushcross Grange, Edgar without Catherine in the face of Heathcliff s son, Heathcliff with Catherine in the face of Hindley s son, Cathy, Catherine, Cathy, more than a name and a pliable soul if the ghosts are anything to go by.

So, spoilers ahead. You have been warned. Also, this is the best place to mention that this is my second reading, and the first time during high school resulted in a one star. The more you know.Emily Bront is, depending on her authorial intent, a genius. Of course, gauging the authorial intent of any author is difficult enough even when they are alive, equipped with a bountiful bibliography, and available for interviews. Determining the intent of a woman dead for more than 160 years who left little to no pieces of work beyond that of her only novel is, well. The words foolish and near impossible come to mind, so my pontifications could be wildly off the mark. But if they aren t, then she is indeed, in my mind, a genius.Let us set the stage. Emily Bront was born in 1818, published Wuthering Heights in 1847, and died in 1848. It is during this 19th century that the racialist consciousness in Europe, birthed during the 16th century in reaction to colonial expansion, achieved its full fledged form as scientific orthodoxy. Colonial expansion encouraged the use of cheap labor, the cheapest labor available was that of slavery, and those who were conquered and differed in physical characteristics from their conquerors fell victim to a pseudoscientific ideological justification that biology determines destiny . These trends spread fast in reaction to those muttering that slavery did not follow neither Christianity nor the rights of man propounded by the earlier age of Enlightenment, and quickly became subsumed in sociocultural ideologies. It is impossible for Bront to not have noticed these trends, and direct evidence of observance is embodied in the character of Heathcliff.As much as visual adaptations like to deny, Heathcliff is a person of color, described as a dark skinned gypsy in aspect a portrayal that was not adhered to till the 2011 production . As soon as he appears in the domicile of the Earnshaws at the age of seven, brought along by a well meaning and overly earnest father, he is referred to as gipsy brat , stupid little thing , and it . The father may be on his side, and the daughter Catherine may grow to become inseparable from him, but the son who has eight years on him and the secondhand narrator who is old enough to help around the house abuse him constantly, and the mother prefers a blind eye in all matters related to the child. Events continue in this fashion until the father dies soon after the mother, preferring his abusive son to his headstrong daughter and wondering how her pretended insolence brought her closer to Heathcliff s heart than his overt kindness.And the son who comes into power in the house In words written by Catherine He has been blaming our father how dared he for treating H. too liberally and swears he will reduce him to his right place In the words of the narrator ...it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in the morning and remain there all day, and the after punishment grew a mere thing to laugh at. Starvation for Catherine, and a flogging for Heathcliff, day in and day out, framed only by Sundays where Joseph, that pious discoursing and self righteous pharisee saw to it to fill their heads with thoughts of blasphemy, death, and hell.I include so much of the beginning because I feel it is necessary to remind those that condemn Heathcliff and wonder at his relationship with Catherine of the childhood they were bequeathed. The events may not excuse him, but they do explain him, and from a character in a novel nothing more can be asked. It must also be mentioned that Heathcliff never reacted with violence to his punishments, but stayed stoic and, in the narrator s words not vindictive . It is this narrator within a narrator, a housekeeper who has been present at nearly all the major events of Heathcliff s life, that is the true mark of Bront s genius, seeking as she is to portray a person of color as a fully developed character that is impossible to pigeonhole as one way or the other. For the narrator is a constant condemner of Heathcliff, as well as anyone who strays outside the boundaries of gender, class, relationships, religion, and above all, race . Come to the glass, and I ll let you see what you should wish. Do you mark those two lines between your eyes and those thick brows, that instead of rising arched, sink in the middle and that couple of black fiends, so deeply buried, who never open their windows boldly, but lurk glinting under them, like devil s spies Wish and learn to smooth away the surly wrinkles, to raise your lids frankly, and change the fiends to confident, innocent angels, suspecting and doubting nothing, and always seeing friends where they are not sure of foes Don t get the expression of a vicious cur that appears to know the kicks it gets are its deserts, and yet hates all the world, as well as the kicker, for what it suffers. In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton s great blue eyes and even forehead, he replied. I do and that won t help me to them. In other words, while Bront often grants the most beautiful phrases and boundless depths of character to Catherine and Heathcliff, she makes sure that the lenses that the reader views them from are from the narrow minded view of a hypocrite, whose only commentary seeks to negatively portray whomever it happens to land upon. So, what do you get when you combine broken class dynamics that by chance mix and meld into strange and unusual forms, each hating the other with contempt and physical violence, aided along by a narrator with no real love for anyone who refuses to conform to her expectations of gender, and ultimately driven by a man who loves and hates the woman who married another in hopes of supporting the one who shares her soul All of which happens to have been initiated by a mewling boy who never really grew out from under the shadow of his father favoring a human being that society has deemed to be lower , and unlike Heathcliff is able for a time to enjoy true happiness with his beloved. Unlike Heathcliff, drowns his sorrows upon her death in drink and attempted destruction of his toddler son, wrecks and ruins his inherited estate to pieces, and yet is held up and pitied by the narrator who deems Heathcliff an evil genius who can do no good. A narrator who leaves a seven month pregnant woman to starve for three days, and whose thoughts towards her are encompassed by She s fainted or dead, I thought, so much the better. Far better that she should be dead, than lingering a burden and a misery maker to all about her. For what For being trapped between two worlds that refuse to reconcile with each other and having to cope with it without the aid of drink and fits of fury that being female is supposed to negate A gentry husband who enjoys the benefits of adhering to the standards of beauty and intelligence determined by upper class society, a hardened soul mate who scorns those weak and spoiled productions of civilization and would rather roam the moors full of knowledge of one s damnation and reveling in it so long as that one person is there by their side A husband who seeks to keep the lines of bigotry pure through ignorance and the building of white towers, and a soul mate who aims to demolish the two houses through the manipulation of descendants whose faces are physical reminders of the ones who tortured his body and twisted his mind, as well as the one who may be gone yet still retains a firm grasp on his very essence And yet, for all Heathcliff s wrathful machinations of revenge in the face of a world that condemned him for being born, despite his rejection of a god that equates the light with good and the dark with evil and his ploys to play the violent self efficiency of one descendant off of the prejudiced self assurance of another, his bloodline ends with a redemption that would have been impossible had the former tragedies been avoided. For through days of ignorance, threats, and fervent loathing, came the slow cracking along lines of former bigotry, bringing one who loved Heathcliff and his wild prowess to rest with one courageous enough to try and understand the man behind the mask woven by general society. No thanks to the narrator, of course, who knew so many sides of the story and favored scolding over explanation, and in fact directly contributed to the horrible chain of events that largely occurred out of misunderstandings acting along trenches of prejudice.Let me make one thing clear. I wouldn t know romantic passion if it hit me over the head with a two by four. However, there are some things I do know the struggle of the individual against the baseless ideology, the search to find the one who embraces them beyond the boundaries of said ideologies, the prejudice of those who conform to said ideologies, the agonies of childhood working their way out physically and psychologically throughout adulthood, the great range of feeling encompassed within human relationships that when intensified doesn t necessarily only intensify one side of the spectrum. The trickiness of narrators, who paint a picture and will often, if you re careful, tell you more about themselves than the image. And finally, the beauty rendered by words of landscapes untouched by the best laid schemes of mice and men, ones I may not have seen but can enjoy in their fullest form nonetheless He said the pleasantest manner of spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening on a bank of heath in the middle of the moors, with the bees humming dreamily about among the bloom, and the larks singing high up over head, and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly. That was his most perfect idea of heaven s happiness mine was rocking in a rustling green tree, with the west wind blowing, and bright, white clouds flitting rapidly above and not only larks, but throstles, and blackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring out music on every side, and the moors seen at a distance, broken into cool dusky dells but close by, great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze and woods and sounding water, and the whole world awake and wild with joy. He wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace I wanted all to sparkle, and dance in a glorious jubilee. Yes. That, I know. My hopes are that Bront knew it, too. "
"23","Wuthering Heights"," 17, 2016 Diane","liked it"," I was not prepared for how bleak this book was. I had seen movie versions of Wuthering Heights, but this was my first time reading the novel, and it was much darker than I expected. So many of the characters are utterly unlikable Cathy is selfish and foolish and obstinate Heathcliff is brutal and vengeful and psychotic Hindley is spiteful and venomous and a drunkard. And when Edgar and Isabella Linton enter the story, everything goes to hell in a handbasket. Why, oh why, did Cathy marry Edgar when she admitted she loved Heathcliff As a reader, I wanted to shake her and scream at her that she was making a disastrous choice. Let s hear it from Cathy herself I ve no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in heaven and if the wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff so low, I shouldn t have thought of it. It would degrade me to marry Heatchliff now so he shall never know how I love him and that, not because he s handsome, Nelly, but because he s more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same and Linton s is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.Yes, I know Cathy felt she couldn t marry Heathcliff because of his low birth and lack of education, but considering how isolated they were in Yorkshire, did it really matter that much Was that Bronte s point that disobeying one s heart by following the courtship rules of one s social class caused suicidal and homicidal ravings I agreed with Heathcliff when he later scolded Cathy for her decision You teach me now how cruel you ve been cruel and false. Why did you despise me Why did you betray your own heart, Cathy I have not one word of comfort. You deserve this. You have killed yourself. Yes, you may kiss me, and cry and wring out my kisses and tears they ll blight you they ll damn you. You loved me then what right had you to leave me What right answer me for the poor fancy you felt for Linton Because misery and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us, you, of your own will, did it. I have not broken your heart you have broken it and in breaking it, you have broken mine.There was such violence in this book Women are beaten and locked up children are bullied and abused punches are thrown, shots are fired, and even dogs are kicked and hung. Egad. I can imagine how shocking it must have been to the good folks of England when it was published in 1847, learning that not only did a woman write it, but that she was a clergyman s daughter, and the story involved a married woman having a tryst with another man. Wowsers. Despite not liking the darkness of the novel, I thought the writing was good and the structure was interesting the servant Nelly Dean relates the history of the doomed love affair to an outsider. The servant was an interloper and kept informed on events in both houses. I can t imagine a more effective way to tell the story of the love triangle. I wouldn t trust either Heathcliff or Cathy or one of the children as a narrator, they might only tell their parent s side of things. Of course, it s also interesting that Nelly Dean may not be a reliable narrator either. She often edits and omits what she tells the master why should we believe she d tell an outsider the whole truth It took me twice as long to get through this novel as it should have it was so bleak that I was hesitant to pick it up. The only other Bronte sister book I ve read was Jane Eyre, which I liked very much, but that love story at least has some warmth in it. In contrast, Wuthering Heights left me feeling cold and bitter. I m glad I ve read it, but I don t think it s one I ll be rereading anytime soon. "
"24","Wuthering Heights"," 10, 2012 s.penkevich","really liked it"," Honest people don t hide their deeds. Emily Bront s Wuthering Heights is a dark and enormously fervent tale of love and obsession. This is not love with lace, frills and flowers, but shorn of all the decorous notions to reveal an intensity more akin to beast than man.It is no surprise that this novel was tough for early critics to swallow, with many citing unlikeable characters and going so far as to declare that the book presents such shocking pictures of the worst forms of humanity from a review published by The Atlas, found on the wiki article . This is by no means a pleasant novel, the atmosphere calls up gothic imagery and emotions with cold, dark, windy nights, gnarled scenery and hushed voices, yet this allows the novel to seize your heart strings and drive you into the madness. The characters are bawdy and cruel, and victims to their raging emotions. The love is passionate and violent and reveals the deep corridors of the heart to be a wild animalistic place.Bront s use of language is fantastic. Some of the more powerful statements on love and obsession are to be found within her pages If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger. Plus, she employs an interesting narrative technique that sets her apart from her contemporaries. The novel is told through an observer, who is relatively inconsequential to the actions at hand for most of the novel. Through journals and first hand accounts of those around him, he pieces together a morbid family history. This allows for multiple voices and perspectives, and keeps the story fresh and flowing. There are slight issues, as a majority of the first half of the book is told through the housekeeper, who recounts the past in potent poetic prose, yet speaks plainly in actual speech. Plus one has to believe that she was able to remember word for word all the loquacious speeches and arguments of the characters. However, a little suspension of disbelief isn t asking much and this technique is used all the time without complaint, plus I ll believe in anything as long as it keeps the novel functioning well. And this novel functions with the best of them.Wittgenstein s Mistress points out that much of this book is just people looking through windows. That is totally accurate. This book will look into the window of the human heart and show you the true emotions of love.This novel is a classic, and rightfully so. It is such a shame that it was her only novel, as with a bit more polishing she could have turned out a shiny diamond of a novel. However, it is the unpolished intensity of this torrid affair that really shines brighter than any diamond ever could. 4 5 "
"25","Wuthering Heights"," 17, 2016 Fabian","liked it"," Believe it or not, not a fan.The story itself is unique very original, a precursor for many Victorian thrillers and haunted house spectaculars. But there was no engine in my brain to ease down the process reading this is like reading something that is altogether MANDATORY. I guess its a classic because enough people have read it to distinguish it from better books.The character of Heathcliff is a vampire who sucks the life out of everyone in the household at Wuthering Heights its neighbors. No doubt a good actor could play the hell out of him and get the Oscar. The work is labyrinthine and sometimes too difficult to understand. It has incredibly unbeautiful sentences really and is altogether irregular not a pleasure at all.This, Catcher in the Rye and Great Gatsby need to vacate the canon. "
"26","Wuthering Heights"," 14, 2007 Russell","it was amazing"," I have a confession I never read this book in high school, so this is the first time I ve read it.This is a stellar book. Heathcliff is a moral poison of the worst sort, and yet there is a part of me that can understand why he was so obsessed and why his obsession led to a hardness and a madness of mind and morals. I can almost appreciate his will, the desire to see his plan execute to the final end, regardless of the cost to others, or to himself. Almost.His withholding of his hand to destroy Cathy and Hareton wasn t because of a change of heart, but because he lacked the passion to keep going.Heathcliff is not a Romantic Hero, despite all the ink spilled otherwise. He could have been, he s set up to be, but his decision to cause pain and exact his revenge on his enemies and their children diverts him from that path.After reading several essays about it huzzah Google I think something that is overlooked as to why Heathcliff acted they way he did wasn t solely for revenge, or that he was so miserable he wanted to make those around him more so. Not just that, he wanted Catherine to haunt him.In his madness I think he was hoping that the destruction of both houses would cause Catherine s spirit to be moved enough to haunt him for his deeds.Then again, maybe not. Nelly Dean confronts him at the end and tells him that he should repent of his wickedness. Heathcliff denies that he has done anything that needed repentance. Perhaps he merely saw this as fitting punishment for those that he felt had wronged him.But in the end, Catherine apparently does haunt Heathcliff, haunts him to the point he dies from lack of interest in the living world.Cathy and Hareton s relationship and presumed marriage nullifies anything Heathcliff did. It was almost like he never existed. The two houses ended up intertwined, despite his scheming and plots.The book was satisfying, and touched on far more themes then I am going to discuss. If you are like me and haven t read the book, I recommend it. "
"27","Wuthering Heights"," 17, 2016 Apatt","it was amazing"," Bad dreams in the nightThey told me I was going to lose the fightLeave behind my wuthering, wutheringWuthering Heights Kate Bush Quoting a pop song s lyrics is not a terribly literary way of starting a classics book review but I considered going with Man That was awesome but decided a shout out to Kate Bush may be the better option. Besides, I first heard of this book when Kate Bush burst upon the scene with this eccentric 1 hit. The lady is a genius, as was Emily Bront .Often mistaken for a great romantic epic, mostly by people who have not read it, Wuthering Heights is a book so dark it is probably best read in braille. I think it is about as romantic as a poke in the eye. It is rightly considered a gothic classic due to its dark brooding gothic atmosphere and supernatural undertone. More importantly, it is a fairly horrifying tale of obsessive love and revenge.Wuthering Heights book sculpture by AnemyaPhotoCreationsI have seen a few online discussions where the forum members hated it when they were assigned to read it in school, and the hatred continues to this day. I don t know if I would have hated it if I was made to read it in school, but reading it now I find it riveting. My fascination with this book lies with the characterization of Heathcliff. Obviously, he wants revenge against all and sundry, most of whom have never actually done him any harm, they just happen to be related to people who pissed him off.Heathcliff seems to spend all his time putting into action his elaborate schemes of revenge. He does not seem to want to do anything with his life except inflicting psychological torture on his wife poor blameless Isabella , his son a whining Bieber like teenager , Catherine Jr. I tagged on the Jr to distinguish her from her mother who is the love of Heathcliff s life , and numerous other people. If revenge is a dish best served cold, cucumber sandwiches are probably his favorite food.The supernatural parts in Wuthering Heights are quite discrete, ghosts seem to appear but they are ambiguously presented as either actual manifestations or stuff of dreams or hallucinations. The eponymous farmhouse Wuthering Heights is also imbued with its own character, a perpetually gloomy, miserable and disquieting place. In any case, the misery of Wuthering Heights is not of the sort of you would find in a Thomas Hardy novel, as there is a subtly spooky feel to the book to balance it out. Besides, the mood does lighten up noticeably toward the end. Interestingly this book is often compared to Jane Eyre by the author s sister Charlotte Bront , both have gothic elements to them though Jane Eyre is not nearly so dark. I could not say which book is better or which one I like more, both are fantastic.I can heartily recommend Wuthering Heights if you don t go into it with an inflexible expectation of what you want it to be about. It is complex, disturbing yet quite an accessible and strangely entertaining read. As with most classics that I read, I opted for an audiobook version. This one I obtained free from the wonderful Librivox, read with consummate skill by Ruth Golding who reminds me of Maggie Smith, sometime austere, sometime motherly. The many voices she acts out for each character is amazing, especially considering that Librivox books are all read for free by volunteers. Some Librivox books are better read than others but as far as this one is concerned there is not much point in shelling out for a professionally read version from Audible.com.Notes Have a look at this video Top 10 Notes Wuthering Heights for a great summary of Wuthering Heights that will enable you to talk knowledgeably about the book even if you have no intention of reading it For a hilarious recap and analysis of Wuthering Height have a look at this Thug Notes Youtube review.

Man do I have to stop being distracted Audio books appear not to be the best format for me, but I did still enjoy. After reading this in high school, I chose to listen to this second time around in the car on my new 40 minute commute. It was great listening about the brooding Heathcliffe, but it was very dark, I don t recall it being quite so in high school. It also seemed shorter. So much death Excellent narration by Hannah Gordon. She perfectly captured male to female, and all of the little bits of laughter and emotions made it a great experience. One of the housekeepers voices was fun to listen to, I don t know how she did it. Talented lady. This book stays on my want to read again list. How silly am I. "
"29","Wuthering Heights"," 08, 2016 Emer ALittleHaze","really liked it"," I was only going to say that Heaven did not seem to be my home and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights where I woke sobbing for joy. I m here staring blankly at my computer screen trying to make sense of what I have just read Wuthering Heights A time honoured classic of English literature, A love story for the ages And I m here sitting like huh What just happened This book was nuts NUTS It was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles, but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn. There were no mutual concessions one stood erect, and the others yielded and who can be ill natured and bad tempered when they encounter neither opposition nor indifference I don t think I ve ever hated and loved something so equally and boy did I hate this at times but then I was also UTTERLY captivated I was so drawn into the manic world of Heathcliff and Catherine and the moors The desolation of the moors, the desolation of these characters... Oh these characters They were the MOST HATEFUL group of characters ever Emily Bront sure knew how to write flawed The things they did to each other IN THE NAME OF LOVE Well if that is mad passionate crazy love then I want no part of it So basically Wuthering Heights it s a soap opera Yup one big giant gothic soap opera of misery and drama And it s not just one love story like I had always thought it s four not that any of the four stories seemed like healthy relationships to me but to each their own I guess I mean especially the fourth love story that s supposed to be the one full of mutual understanding and tenderness but by that stage of the book well . perhaps I need to forgive and forget more easily It is hard to write a review of this without spoiling the plot and I don t want to ruin it on anyone so if this review seems like one long rather random rambling stream of utter nonsense from me then I do apologise The central themes of Wuthering Heights are love and revenge and what cosy bedfellows they make Catherine and Heathcliff are brought up together, they are both as wild as each other and are passionate about each other but something happens to cause Catherine to view Heathcliff in a less than favourable light with regards to marriage and she belittles his station in life. And thus begins the corruption of Heathcliff and my god does he become the MOST VENGEFUL character that you could deign to meet. And because his happiness has been irrevocably destroyed he is bent on destroying everyone around him and I mean DESTROY and so he plots demises that span the generations. Yeah Heathcliff not someone who forgives and forgets easily It was actually quite hard reading about someone so horrid okay he absolutely had his reasons and you can argue how he was driven to it, motive etc... But it was incessant revenge, Incessant hatred, Incessant vitriol And I as a reader found it quite exhausting at times. I suppose that probably illustrates the tension in this novel Everything is SO intense EVERYTHING Gosh I m tired just thinking about it... I required FREQUENT naps when reading this okay I m still recovering from some pretty heavy surgery so that might have impacted on that too but still HEAVY GOING So did I like it I honestly don t know I am utterly confused There were times I wanted to fling this book down and there were times when I could not get enough . Your cold blood cannot be worked into a fever your veins are full of ice water but mine are boiling, and the sight of such chillness makes them dance. The language of the book oh I could get lost in it. It really did feel like a whole other world. The descriptions of the wild moors, the weather it really mirrored the wildness of Cathy and Heathcliff. How they could never be constrained by things such as civility or decorum. But there was this one character... Joseph .. BAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH His contributions to the book were written in this terribly peculiar olden English, heavily accented style that I just could not follow. UTTERLY befuddled I was my edition definitely needed some Cliff s notes to go with it So every time his character spoke I just got lost sad face ... so that was something I had to learn to deal with.The narration I m sorry to say I wasn t a fan. I didn t enjoy having the story of Heathcliff and Cathy related to me. I guess I just wanted to be in their heads more I suppose this was where I needed some sort of empathy with the characters but who am I to judge Emily Bront s writing style. It is considered a classic but oh if only I could have seen inside Heathcliff s head for but a moment What ifs sigh The romance between Heathcliff and Catherine well it was intense and heady but toxic. So very toxic Trust me Heathcliff ain t ever gonna be your book boyfriend Unless you have extremely singular taste But did I ever truly root for their love For their living happily ever after Well not really And again this goes back to the narration If it had been written from Heathcliff s or Cathy s points of view then perhaps I would have invested more in the romance but I always felt like an onlooker in this story. Do you know that notion of watching a car crash no one wants to see it but you can t take your eyes away... That is Heathcliff and Cathy And boy do they love each other fiercely You teach me now how cruel you ve been cruel and false. Why did you despise me Why did you betray your own heart Cathy I have not one word of comfort. You deserve this. You have killed yourself. Yes you may kiss me and cry and wring out my kisses and tears they ll blight you they ll damn you. You loved me then what right had you to leave me What right answer me Because misery and degradation and death, and nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us, you, of your own will, did it. I have not broken your heart you have broken it and in breaking it, you have broken mine. So much the worse for me, that I am strong. Do I want to live What kind of living will it be when you oh God Would you like to live with your soul in the grave Let me alone, let me alone, sobbed Catherine. If I ve done wrong, I m dying for it. It is enough You left me too but I won t upbraid you I forgive you. Forgive me It is hard to forgive and to look at those eyes and feel those wasted hands he answered. Kiss me again and don t let me see your eyes I forgive what you have done to me. I love my murderer but yours How can I So rating this book . I am utterly baffled . I can justify rating it a two at times and at others a four IT MAKES NO SENSE I make no sense So do I say three That just seems so low For a book that inspired so many emotions in me and for a book that is so wonderfully written I guess four is fair but I reserve the right to come back and change it every day for the next year Should you read Wuthering Heights OF COURSE Eh it s a classic and there is great joy to be had among its pages It s a kind of popcorn classic Read this with lots and lots of snacks, revel in the ridiculousness of it all and just enjoy the ride Four bonkers stars because he s more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same Edit 28 04 2016See I knew something crazy like this would happen with this book. It has been 6 or 7 weeks since I read this and it has been on my mind on and off the whole time. So at first I said I was gonna rate this two stars because it drove me so insane. Then I thought maybe three....until I finally settled on four.SCRATCH ALL THAT THIS IS GETTING THE FULL FIVE STARS The more I reflect on this novel the more I think about its brilliance. It has just gotten under my skin and wormed its way into my heart in among my five star favourites. This book is ridiculous Bonkers Insane Off the wall Oh you name the kind of crazy and this book is it And I love it completely Sometimes love really does just creep up on you I guess Edit 24 09 2016Okay so after MUCH deliberation I m rounding back down to my original four star rating... But I still insist that everyone needs to read this book I m just feeling a bit funny about my five star rating..... Because my relationship with Heathcliff It s complicated But I still UTTERLY love him..... sigh "
"30","Wuthering Heights"," 09, 2016 Stacey prettybooks","liked it"," This post is part of the 2015 Classics Challenge. Spoiler alert I found it impossible to talk about Wuthering Heights without saying too much, so don t read ahead if you would prefer to know nothing about the book WHEN I Discovered This ClassicI have no idea Wuthering Heights would have been one of the first classics I ever heard about, surely Or perhaps I first heard Wuthering Heights by Kate Bush as a young child. But it was one that kept cropping up as a book I had to read.WHY I Chose to Read It It s a popular classic and the only one in the Goodreads top ten that I hadn t read. I received a lovely Penguin English Library edition through Caboodle. What I love about older classics is that I can switch between reading a physical copy and the eBook on my Kindle iPad. I started the eBook on my way back to London from Bath and enjoyed sharing quotes on Goodreads Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff s dwelling. Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. WHAT Makes It A ClassicI expected Wuthering Heights to be a classic romance story about a young couple, Cathy and Heathcliff. I expected them to roam the Yorkshire moors, proclaiming their love for each other. But it s much more than that and I m not completely certain that it is a love story. Wuthering Heights has elements of a Gothic horror story. An intense story about revenge, betrayal, anger and jealousy, it s written in beautiful the prose that the Bront sisters are known for.I found Wuthering Heights confusing at first because we re introduced to a myriad of characters I suggest viewing a family tree, although it will give you spoilers. We then become familiar with the Earnshaws and the Lintons, two families caught up Cathy and Heathcliff s drama as well as their own conflicts. It s narrated mainly by Mr. Lockwood a tenant of Heathcliff s and Nelly a housekeeper who was close to both families . Even so, it was Cathy and Heathcliff that kept me reading and I understand why they re the most memorable part of the novel.WHAT I Thought of This ClassicBefore you ask, if I had to pick, I d choose Jane Eyre, one of my favourite classics so far and I probably should have rated it 5 rather than 4 . I also need to read Samantha Ellis How to Be a Herione , which particularly focuses on Catherine Earnshaw and Jane Eyre.I expected a lot from Wuthering Heights and was pleasantly surprised it s full of awful characters that I couldn t tear my eyes away from and conflicts that were both terrible and exciting. I wasn t prepared for the amount of mental and physical cruelty I didn t know that the book began with Mr. Lockwood and that we wouldn t get to hear directly from Catherine and Heathcliff. I didn t know that the book was split into two parts Nelly s flashbacks to the story of Catherine and Heathcliff and then the present day, about 18 years later. I am baffled as to why people envy Cathy and Heathcliff s relationship, but it was certainly an enjoyable one to read about I adored the drama and Catherine s fiery personality.Even though the second part of the novel wasn t as enjoyable for me, I liked discovering that Wuthering Heights was more complicated than expected and that this troublesome story and cast of vivid characters finally came full circle. As it is titled Wuthering Heights, it doesn t surprise me now to realise it s really a story of Heathcliff s life and transformation from the damaged young boy in his childhood to his eventual death in his late thirties, as master of Wuthering Heights. It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now so he shall never know how I love him and that, not because he s handsome, Nelly, but because he s more myself than I am. WILL It Stay A ClassicI expect so because the story of Cathy and Heathcliff continues to draw people in, although they re only part of the story. WHO I d Recommend It ToPeople who enjoyed Jane Eyre and want to read another classic Bront story. People who are curious about Cathy and Heathcliff but are prepared to experience much more. People who enjoy intense drama My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods time will change it, I m well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff I also reviewed this book over on Pretty Books. "

I was not attracted to him I thought he caused all the pain for himself and DESERVED to be haunted How can this be considered a love story Seriously Jane Eyre was better written by far and did not take long for me to swoon over Mr. Rochester, but Emily s book just fell short. I feel sorry for Charlotte, since I think more students are forced to study Wuthering Heights rather than Jane Eyre. I digress...I empathized most with Hareton, pronounced on the cd as Hayton the son of Edgar Linton who was raised by Heathcliff. Raised , more like abused His character was the only one that stood out for me as being more than caricature. He s the real tragic hero, in my opinion. And I m glad he got a happy ending. The ending is what made the book worthwhile, but still falls short when compared to other classics .In short, this book was a beating. "
"32","Wuthering Heights"," 26, 2016 Matt","really liked it"," When my book club picked Wuthering Heights, I had the vaguest of notions of what it was about. A romance in the moors, I thought. I recalled a movie trailer from the past, people standing in the rain, staring at each other with smoldering eyes people standing in the fog, staring at each other with smoldering eyes people staring at each other, staring, staring, staring. Also a snippet of dialogue popped into my head, overwrought and purple, the twist of phrase that sends teenage lit nerds into paroxysms My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods time will change it, I m well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff He s always, always in my mind not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being. My book club is composed of six guys. We started the book club because we were tired of our wives having all the fun and drinking all the wine at their own gatherings. After our second time cycling through the club, with each member picking a book, Adam s wife pointed out that we d yet to read a female author. Adam decided to remedy this by picking Wuthering Heights, which had struck some kind of chord with him in high school. Based on my recollections, as noted above, I wasn t particularly looking forward to it. I believed in romance once, a long time and two kids ago, but it s hard for me to get excited about notions of love resembling the eternal rocks. Lucky for me, this isn t anything like a typical love story. Wuthering Heights is set in the bleak, chilly, forlorn Yorkshire moors. The story begins in needlessly complicated fashion with the new tenant of Thrushcross Grange, a man named Lockwood who narrates in the first person going to meet his landlord Heathcliff, who lives at Wuthering Heights. Lockwood is taken aback at the odd characters he meets at the Heights the rude, taciturn Heathcliff a young woman and a strange young man who appears to be a servant. There is a snowstorm and Lockwood is forced to spend an uncomfortable, nightmare ridden night at Wuthering Heights. When Lockwood returns to Thrushcross Grange, he asks his housekeeper, Nelly Dean, about the strange goings on at the Heights. At this point, Nelly takes over the first person narration to tell the bulk of the story. In other words, this is a Conrad esque nested narrative, where there are stories within stories within stories. Frankly, I find this literary technique irritating and confusing. Just use the third person It s much more believable Nelly s sprawling tale begins as a love affair between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw. It was Catherine s father who came upon the homeless Heathcliff while on a trip to Liverpool. He brought Heathcliff back to Wuthering Heights to live with him, Catherine, and Catherine s brother Hindley. Heathcliff and Hindley don t like each other, but Catherine and Heathcliff do. A neighbor named Edgar Linton joins this crowd, wooing Catherine. At some point, Heathcliff runs off, Edgar marries Catherine, Heathcliff returns, and the melodrama begins At this point, I m going to stop with the plot points. For one, I m not SparkNotes, or CliffsNotes, if you re of a certain age and no, I won t help you write your term paper . For another, I can t keep the convolutions straight myself. This is a tangled book, filled with characters who are similarly named Heathcliff and Hareton, Lindley and Linton, Catherine and Cathy . Suffice to say, there are EMOTIONS involved. Very strong emotions. As in character in a Russian novel strong. Wuthering Heights is one of those Romantic novels in which spiritual or emotional illness will manifest into a physical illness that can literally kill you. My initial emotion, since we re on the topic, was one of dislike. I didn t like Wuthering Heights. I did not like the long, tedious introductory chapters narrated by Lockwood. I did not like the characters who all with the exception of the saintly Nelly Dean came across as either cruel, stupid, or both. I hated the character of Joseph, an old coot with a religious bent who speaks in an indecipherable colloquial dialect. At first, I used the annotations at the back of my Penguin edition to translate Joseph s mutterings. Eventually, up against a book club deadline, I started skipping everything he said . I did not care for the hyper passionate dialogue, or the occasionally murky prose. The more I thought about it, though, the more I came to respect Wuthering Heights. It is exceptionally sinister, with long sections of the story an epic mind f k coordinated by a vengeful Heathcliff. It is psychologically dark, if not especially deep. It is a work of fiction that demands discussion, and explodes with dozens of meanings depending on who is doing the reading. No one will ever know what Emily Bronte intended when she wrote Wuthering Heights. She died shortly after publication, and due to her gender, and her famous sisters, it was sometimes hard to convince people she even wrote it. Regardless, it is a work of imaginative genius. I ve always loved reading but I ve always hated being told what to read. It s my only real authority issues. Even in book club I sometimes get sulky and resentful when certain titles are chosen. I trace this issue back to all my English classes, and all the turgid classics I ve been assigned throughout the years. When I finally finished my last class in a pedagogical era that lasted twenty years, the first thought I had was I can read whatever I want True story after I finished the bar exam, most of my classmates gathered for an epic drunk. I stayed home and fulfilled my dream of reading a book while eating Pizza Hut pizza . Every once in awhile, I d try to throw a classic into my reading list, mainly for that sense of intellectual superiority that comes with being highbrow, if only for a fleeting moment. The younger, mid twenties version of myself still felt a residual resentment. I d read something like Moby Dick and almost be angry at it. Angry at its difficulty angry that people thought it was so good, and kept saying so, when it was self evidently so ponderous and syntactically tortured. Now I m coming to realize the value in wrestling with a book. For the most part, I still value a certain level of clarity when I read, because reading is fundamentally about communication. But the older version of myself can appreciate that extracting the meaning of something is worthwhile in itself. So I fought with Wuthering Heights, and the battle ended as a draw. And unlike Moby Dick, Wuthering Heights did not end up in the fireplace. "

Some are inspired by dreams or illusions. Still others are re telling of earlier works. I searched entries in Google and I could not find where Emily Bronte got his inspiration for this novel aside from the place called Haworth, where Emily s father was perpetual curate and it was in these surroundings that the sisters Charlotte and Anne were also novelists like Emily literary gifts flourished. So it must be the place. We all know that for some novelist, the surroundings are important when they write their novels Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. These are the two estates that define the many contrasts that Bronte effectively used to heighten the beauty of this novel. The name of the novel comes from the Yorkshire manor on the moors on which the story centers as an adjective wuthering is a Yorkshire word referring to turbulent weather and heights denotes imposing structure like a tower or a building. On the other hand, grange means a building for storing grain a granary and trushcross seems to signify a place that is nurturing, serene and peaceful. This primary contrast seems to perpetuate the many others that the novel has The Earnshaw family Mr. Mrs. Earnshaw, their son Hindley, their daughter Catherine and their adopted son, Heathcliff who lives in the Wuthering Heights are also people who are hateful, vengeful and cunning in contrast with the Linton family Mr. Mrs. Linton, their son Edgar and their daughter Isabella.Catherine loves Heathcliff but Hindley despises him. So, Catherine marries Edgar. Heathcliff goes away and when he returns he is already filthy rich so he works on his revenge. Catherine dies after giving birth to her daughter, the young Catherine. The she dies but in her deathbed, Heathcliff curses her to haunt him as long as he lives. Heathcliff marries Isabella who bears him a son, Linton and Heathcliff wants Catherine and Linton to marry each other because he hates his son as he still loves the dead Catherine. When Edgar dies, Heathcliff tells the gravedigger to dig the older Catherine s grave and when Heathcliff sees that her corpse does not decompose yet, he says that Catherine is waiting for his death for them to their dusts to mingle and decompose together.True love. Eternal love. Love that turns into obsession is the main theme of this novel and even if the characters especially but not limited to Heathcliff exhibit all the hate and anger that permeates the bulk of the story, you cannot help but emphatize with them. After all the hardships and early deaths due to sickness which must be due to loneliness and grief, still when you think about it, this is the same situation as Shakespeare s doomed lovers, Romeo and Juliet. The love that Catherine and Heathcliff have for each other was not allowed to prosper and it led to hate, misery and carried over even to the next generation of their families. It is a sad tragic love story that has withstood the test of time. It is a classic work that has been read by many generations and still to be read by future ones.I have no other rating for this book except 5 stars. "

I mean how can you like anyone in this novel People say Nelly Dean is a nice character but we don t know anything about her past She is the most unreliable narrator in the history of fiction I ve heard people say this is a love story. Well, I don t think they actually read this novel. If tormented souls literally digging up corpses of loved ones is your idea of love then you are probably Dexter or someone. I don t even know how to review this. Near the end I had to take it chapter by chapter. It was SO depressing I couldn t even stand it I read a chapter, then watched Clueless, read a chapter, then watched Labyrinth, read a chapter, then watched Romy and Michele s High School Reunion, I needed to flush each chapter out with teen comedies DO NOT read this book if you are in any way depressed or sad about something because it will drive you mental and you ll end up like Heathcliff. Even though I hated everyone and everything was so depressing, I still loved it. It s not up there with her sister s work Jane Eyre but it s not as boring as Pride and Prejudice . "

"37","Wuthering Heights"," 19, 2008 J","it was amazing"," When one thinks of books of the past, one typically thinks that today s novels and entertainments are far more violent and vicious. There is a tendency to think of our own generation or the one or two immediately preceding ours as having invented sexual perversions, brutal literature, and genre bending and mixing. No one truly believes this intently, but it is a kind of humming substratum to our lives. That previous ages were simpler and more innocent and better and more pure and wholesome is not only a nostalgic commonplace, but it also one of the traditional props to conservatism. Back when I was a kid is a statement denoting how old you ve become and is either followed with things were a lot more etc. or we never etc. The first few pages of Wuthering Heights must surely disabuse of anyone of this notion of the good old days. We are introduced to Mr. Lockwood, a young man in retirement from some private sorrow, who ends up at Thrushcross Grange. Upon visiting the home of his landlord, the famed Mr. Heathcliff, he is set upon by a dog, Heathcliff abuses both him and all of his servants, Joseph, Hareton Earnshaw who is also Heathcliff s nephew , and his own daughter in law. What unfolds is a tale of madness, revenge, rage, and abuse that puts many a melodramatic serial killer novel of today to shame for the sheer vituperrious spite.And as the book progresses, Emily Bront shows herself no slouch in putting plain savagery and abomination on the page. Catherine, the young sister of the adopted Heathcliff, with whom he falls in love, as just a teenage girl slaps a servant, beats a small baby, then turns on her cousin Edgar Linton and boxes his ear. Her older brother, Hindley, gets drunk and attacks everyone, plays with his rifle, abuses his child, and tries to shove a carving knife down his servant s throat. Isabelle Linton, the sister of Edgar and Heathcliff s later wife , on being held by Catherine, sinks her fingernails into the woman s arm. After her departure, Catherine tells Heathcliff that such nails would dart for his eyes to this he promises he d wrench them off her fingers should she even try. When a boy, Hareton throws a rock at his nurse and damns her when he first sees her after many years.All in all, the book is a primer on the vicious circle that is revenge and hatred. One can easily imagine, while reading this book, all the characters in a circle, everyone beating the person first in front of him or her and being beaten by the one behind in turn. And so it turns, on and on. If literature of that time was generally expected to demonstrate some kind of moral, Wuthering Heights demonstrates it in the inverse.What sets everything in motion is the maltreatment of the found orphan, Heathcliff which starts from the very beginning with everyone calling him an it. His ferocious revenge is, while truly awful in all senses of the word, such a profound manifestation of hatred against everything, against the entire world, himself included, that he rises or is it sinks to the level of supreme tragic hero. He is like a Samson destroying the temple with his own soul within it. Emily Bront is remarkably less sympathetic to Catherine, with whom she deals rather sternly whereas Heathcliff gets the backlit, shadowy, windswept fen romanticism. She is Frankenstein, while he is Shelley s monster, a tortured agent of vengeance.What is amusing about this kind of novel, amusing for literally dozens of novels of the nineteenth century, is the level of suspension of disbelief the mechanics of the book require. Firstly, there is the narrator himself, Mr. Lockwood, Heathcliff s tenant, who tells the story of being told the tale by Ellen Dean, the nurse who witnessed most events and tells it in a pastiche of letters, personal recollections, gossip told to her, and other such secondary type narrative devices. It is a story about a story about various stories. And we are to accept Ellen having such a detailed memory as well as Mr. Lockwood.This is something we simply overlook after a certain point that we disregard that we overlook it is rather interesting and a stirring testimonial to Emily Bront s skill as a novelist. That this should be her only novel is a powerful statement to its lasting fame and a melancholy fact that such writing should be confined solely between two covers and no more. I never finish Wuthering Heights but wish there were a second Emily Bront novel to read. Alas for the tuberculosis that ravished the family at least three of the sisters died from it, and there is conflicting evidence that it killed the remaining sister and the only brother . That Emily had two sisters who were also novelists is scant consolation, no matter how enjoyable their novels may be. That she died at just thirty is as tragic as Keats death at twenty five. That the Oxford English Dictionary to this day doesn t recognize and define wuthering is a shame in and of itself. "
"38","Wuthering Heights"," 30, 2011 Brad","it was amazing"," Wuthering Heights is many things. A late gothic ghost story. A tale of love and revenge. A chronicle of violence physical, mental, emotional and social. A dark peek into human nature. A condemnation of England s broken class system. A sort of anti Austen book without manners.I ve loved it since I first read it in grade eight. It s another of the books my crazy cool Mom foisted upon me in her big, three year pushing of classics that defined my reading tastes for the rest of my life. I love the book so much, and Emily Bront s leading man, that I named my daughter Bront dooming her, no doubt, to a life of pain, depression, and unfinished business, sorry T .This time through, however, I found myself not caring a whit about Heathcliff and Catherine the Older, or Hareton and Catherine the Younger, or Edgar, or Isabella, or Linton the king whinger. I found myself caring about Nelly Dean, and only Nelly Dean. And in so doing I discovered another thing that Wuthering Heights is the most circuitous character sketch in the English language. To read Wuthering Heights caring only about Nelly is to read an entirely different story. Suddenly the ill fated love of Heathcliff and Cathy the torture and pain and ghosts and revenge becomes the way Nelly reveals herself, and the unreliability of Nelly as a narrator becomes the very stuff of herself. Every action she comments on, every action she claims to take, every piece of those tales she tells Lockwood cease to be about her subjects and, instead, reveal her as the subject. She is the star of her own narrative, and all those characters she claims to love or hate are mere supporting players to a servant s tale of herself. Which, for me, makes Wuthering Heights even more brilliant than I ve always believed it to be. I wonder what a stage version of this would look like if one were to use Nelly s perspective AND make her the focus, subverting her attempts to obfuscate her importance. Maybe I should take a crack at it. Or maybe I could just pass the idea on to my very own Bront . I bet she could do something magnificent with it someday. "

Heck, a lot of the time the villains are more interesting and enjoyable then the heroes. So I have to pause here and say congratulations Miss Bronte, you ve managed what no one else to date has been able to accomplish. I hate Heathcliff,He is arguably one of the stupidest, pettiest, most self centered and spiteful characters in literature. And by stupid I don t mean unintelligent throughout the entire book he displays, if not a book larnin type of smarts, at least a serious level of cunning and guile , I mean this is a man who makes a critically poor choice his love for Catherine. Catherine manages to rival Heathcliff by being a conceited, spoiled, tantrum throwing baby all the way through her womanhood, and therein lies the crux of the problem with this whole book. The entire plot hinges on Heathcliff and Catherine s love, and Heathcliff s revenge after her death against those he blames for keeping the two lovers apart. But Catherine is so blatantly unlikeable that I just couldn t buy into their romance, and, by extension, the rest of the novel. It would be like writing Pol Pot a love letter no matter how pure the words and intent, the entire basis of the act is so ludicrous it would be impossible to take seriously. Every time he performs some loathsome deed it s multiplied a hundredfold when you remember the daffy bitch who s memory he s doing it for by the end of the book you can t help but feel that the only true injustice in the story is that Heathcliff dies in his sleep instead of being torn apart by animals.Not that I can really lay all of the character flaws at Heathcliff and Catherine s doorsteps the dramatis personae for Wuthering Heights is a veritable buffet of loathsomeness. Cathy is almost as spoiled and conceited as her mother. Linton is spineless, manipulative, whiny little husk and clearly not a bully for the sole reason that he s too sickly to be one. You get the feeling that he s the kind of kid that would torture animals if he could, and Cathy s affections for him make as little sense as Heathcliff s love for Catherine. Hindley is spiteful, cowardly, drunken wreck, and his abuse of Heathcliff at the beginning of the book probably makes him the most responsible for every bad thing that happens in the story next to Heathcliff himself. Isabella is a brainless, starry eyed idiot Edgar falls in love with Catherine, marries her, and suffers the consequences despite mounds of evidence that bitch be crazy Joseph is a raving fundamentalist. The only two characters in the entire book you can feel at all bad for are Nelly Dean, who s drug into pretty much everything bad that happens against her will, and Hareton , who s character flaws are by and large thrust on him by others and aren t his fault. In the end, the characters torpedo the story. Although the novel is beautifully written and evocative, there s just so little to enjoy here that it s hard for me to imagine opening this book up again any time soon. "
"42","Wuthering Heights"," 11, 2015 Alex","it was amazing"," Wuthering Heights takes place in a dark, tiny, parallel place, like one of those rolled up dimensions string theorists like to talk about. Whether the supernatural exists there is uncertain. The law doesn t, except abstractly. It s a more violent world than ours, more intense. Like the writer of the Penguin edition s preface, I had been under the impression that Wuthering Heights was a great love story. Instead it s a great hate story. A likable even tolerable character doesn t show up before Catherine junior we ll call her Cathy until then we have to negotiate the milquetoast Edgar, the narcissistic and mentally unstable Catherine, the nurse Ellen, who makes Juliet s nurse look like an angel, and, of course, Heathcliff, who is possibly possessed by a demon.Toward the end of the book we get a mirror image of view spoiler the Catherine Heathcliff relationship in Cathy and Hareton. Cathy has Edgar s sweetness and Catherine s spirit, which turns out to be a pretty good mix and although Heathcliff tries to turn Hareton into himself, since Hareton is not possessed by a demon he just turns out rugged. While Cathy can be impetuous and cruel, like when she says He s just like a dog...or a cart horse Ch. 32 , Hareton refuses to take her bait. Cathy isn t as nuts as her mother, but still, I think the point here is that Catherine might have had a chance at happiness, but was destroyed by Heathcliff s malice. hide spoiler I can see why a book about awful people destroying each other might turn some folks off. But I like my coffee black, so I loved every minute of it. This is a book that knows fiercely what it is. I felt like an outsider here a feeling heightened by the book s storytelling framing device, which serves as an epistolary does to distance the reader from the action. I don t fully understand this world but Emily does, and she adheres scrupulously to its weird rules. It s amazingly tightly plotted and conceived. And a total page turner, which isn t unimportant. It s black, and melodramatic, and strange, and brilliant. "

"44","Wuthering Heights"," 25, 2016 Jasmine","it was amazing"," I promise, one day I will write a proper review of Emily Bront s Wuthering Heights in order to pay tribute to this masterpiece of English Literature. Emily Bront s powerful writing struck me like a thunderbolt. I was not anticipating this at all, for I did not have great expectations when I started reading the book. I was aware that a lot of readers dislike the book. Yes, there is brutality, rawness, untamed ferocity, drama. Only a highly talented writer like Emily Bront would be capable of melting these ingredients into a fascinating tale of passion, obsession and vengeance. While reading it, the story often reminded me of a Greek tragedy with infuriated earth goddesses a.k.a. Catherine and ancient vengeful sky gods a.k.a. Heathcliff . Nonetheless, in the end there is still hope of overcoming illiteracy and resentfulness. With her story Emily Bront clearly overstepped Victorian boundaries regarding gender roles, morality, race and social ranks. How was it possible for a 29 year old parson s daughter in 1847 to write such an unconventional compelling story No wonder Victorian readers were shocked. I, for my part, absolutely loved Emily s wonderful structured story with unreliable narrators and strong characters. Be assured, this book will not let go of me so quickly. I will come back and write another review. In the meantime, have a look at the following short video from The British Library. It gives you a fascinating insight without too many spoilers. https www.youtube.com watch v fyGNV... "

"46","Wuthering Heights"," 28, 2007 Nicole","it was amazing"," The first time I read Wuthering Heights in English class, senior year I could not stand it. Turns out, I couldn t stand my Senior Year English teacher. Had to re read it for a Gothic Lit course in college and, though dreading it, I had the complete opposite reaction to the book.It s now one of my top five favorite books I ve ever read. It is so layered and complex emotionally, psychologically, technically that every time I read it my copy is so battered and marked up I find more and more details and perspectives on characters, scenes, and the whole book. My favorite feature of the book is definitely the layered narraration. As readers, we are first introduced to Mr Lockwood. as he approaches the Heights and the end of our tale. But after he settles at the Grange and begins to speak with Nellie Dean, the story truly begins to unfold. Though neither are entirely reliable for their own sakes, the unrealiability of narraration is compounded when we realize that in many cases, Nellie herself is not a first hand witness to these events. What has she emphasized What has she left out What has she simply gotten wrong or made up And how much of her and Mr. Lockwood honesty really matters Together they tell a beautiful and heartbreaking story. Many time it seems as though stories about love grow bigger than the love itself. This is not the case here, but it is not always love either. Wuthering Heights more intimately explores the darker side of love how much we can hate the one with love for NOT loving us in return, and how much MORE we may hate them if they do. "

"49","Wuthering Heights"," 21, 2014 Haya nother book Junkie","it was amazing"," FIVE STARS Wuthering HeightsBY Emily Bront So for people who read my reviews, and know how i write, you have probably guessed that English is not in fact my mother tongue I have been learning English in school since i was 10, but school cannot teach you how to learn a language properly so now that i am in University, i m studying English Literature, and this is exactly why i am reading Wuthering Heights for the first time. My Literature teacher asked us to give oral presentations about any British literary work we are interested in. Everyone choose poems and short stories, i was the only one who choose a novel i choose Emily Bront , simple because i was curious about this so called Wuthering Heights and it is a shame that at this age i still haven t read it, so i read it Let me just say, what we are reading nowadays is absolutely Rubbish , NOTHING can compare to a classic that is well wriiten as Wuthering Heights Emily Bront is a genius. how she could possible write such a story, is it beyond me, i thought this story was way beyond its time, but yet again we really should not underestimate the power of imagination.In my Presentation i focused mostly on the love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. I also talked about how selfish and cruel Catherine was i talked about how she used Heathcliff love againts him, how she wanted him to sit and watch her marry another guy, and not move on it was like she s saying you sit here and watch me me marry another guy, and stay in love with me, don t go anywhere, you are not allowed to move on, just sit there and watch me WHAT IS WONG WITH YOU Catherine Earnshaw is probably the worst character i have ever read about, in classic or in a modern work But then maybe she was this way because she really was just a kid i mean she dies in the story when she was 18 19 so she didn t get to have any life experiences the same goes for Heathcliff. Everything Heathcliff did was justified i loved this character. I cried at a lot of scenes, he went through so much, so much suffering and heartache. Heathcliff is beautiful, yet ugly in ways that defy the ordinary imagination i thought that he didn t love Catherine as Catherine he loved the idea behind her, and he LOVED how she was when she was a kid, and he was stuck there he thought she was the same nice, gentle girl he grew up to love, and not this selfish, self centered woman.This story is timeless. REVIEWSOF WUTHERING HEIGHTS Reviewer AnonymousPublication New Monthly MagazineDate January 1848Wuthering Heights, by Ellis Bell, is a terrific story, associated with an equally fearful and repulsive spot. It should have been called Withering Heights, for any thing from which the mind and body would more instinctively shrink, than the mansion and its tenants, cannot be imagined. ...Our novel reading experience does not enable us to refer to anything to be compared with the personages we are introduced to at this desolate spot a perfect misanthropist s heaven.Reviewer AnonymousPublication Graham s Lady s Magazine USA Date July 1848How a human being could have attempted such a book as the present without committing suicide before he had finished a dozen chapters, is a mystery.

It was published in 1847 under the pseudonym Ellis Bell Emily Bront died the following year, aged 30. In 1850, when a second edition of Wuthering Heights was due, Charlotte Bront edited the original text, altering punctuation, correcting spelling errors and making Joseph s heavy Yorkshire dialect less impenetrable. The novel was widely rejected by the Victorian readership because of its strong depiction of cruelty and inhumanity and because of the way in which it challenged strict Victorian ideals, touching on religious hypocrisy and issues of morality, social injustice and gender inequality. At the time of its publication, critics acknowledged the novel s power and imagination, but were confounded by the storyline and found the characters extremely brash and uninhibited. The Victorian novel was known for its realism, a literary movement that sought to portray life as it really is, even in its most mundane manifestations. However, in Wuthering Heights, Emily Bront makes a point of making the reader feel dislodged and unstable, making the narrative seem as if it existed in a world entirely separate from our own. This is reinforced from the outset by the geographic isolation of the novel s location. The strangeness is also amplified in the complicated narrative framework at one given moment, we find ourselves reading Lockwood s version of Nelly s version of Isabella s version of what took place enhancing the readers bewilderment through the lack of direct contact with the actual facts and events. This, coupled with the novels encroachment on Victorian taboos, explains its hostile reception. Its present day popularity dates back to the beginning of the 20th century and today Wuthering Heights is widely recognized as one of the classics of 19th century English literature and is a set book on both A level and university syllabuses. Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon in the 1939 film Wuthering Heights I want you to be aware that I know you have treated me infernally infernally Do you hear And if you flatter yourself that I don t perceive it, you are a fool and if you think I can be consoled by sweet words, you are an idiot and if you fancy I ll suffer unrevenged, I ll convince you of the contrary, in a very little while When I picked up this book I was expecting an intense and tumultuous love story set on the Yorkshire Moors, however neither the Kate Bush song of my youth, Wuthering Heights, nor the film starring Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon prepared me for the book that lay in my lap and which proved to be of a completely different nature. The novel is a violent story of revenge, abounding in physical and mental cruelty. It recounts the life of Heathcliff, a mysterious dark skinned gypsy like street urchin, from his childhood to his death in his late thirties. Heathcliff is initially welcomed as a son into the Earnshaw family by his adoptive parents, but after his foster father s death, Heathcliff s status is reduced to that of a servant. Heathcliff is in love with Catherine, his adoptive sister, and runs away when she decides to marry another. He returns later, rich and educated, and sets about enacting his revenge on the two families that he believed ruined his life.There is a strong sense of dualism in this novel the stifling domestic indoors which contrasts with the liberating air of the outdoors two families two houses male and female the novel is divided into two sections about two love stories, recounted by two different narrators and even the character of Heathcliff has a dual nature both villain and hero. However this duality is never really resolved we are not invited to judge and either condemn or condone. The book lacks a moral core and there are no ethical standards, this is reinforced by the negative portrayal of religion. Its success seems to lie in its primeval force and wealth of facets morality, religion, illegitimacy, incest, gender equality, social injustice. Each generation finds a reflection of its preoccupations within its volatile content.Wuthering Heights is a wild, savage and subversive novel, it spews forth the violent nature of love like a volcano, engulfing and burring everything in its path under a suffocating layer of molten lava. It depicts, in sulphurous language, how love blinds how it distorts reality how it leads to selfishness, incomprehension and finally to destructive obsession. The love portrayed by Emily Bront is an addiction, breaking down the boundaries of identity, merging with the lover into one identity, and replacing God. The Wild Moors by wanderingsoul Love blinds Heathcliff s adoptive father s blind favouritism turns the entire household with the exception of Catherine against Heathcliff So, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in the house and at Mrs. Earnshaw s death, which happened in less than two years after, the young master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather than a friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parent s affections and his privileges and he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries. Love distorts reality Catherine believes that by choosing to marry Linton, she is making the right decision, not for her betrothed, not for herself but for Heathcliff Nelly, I see now you think me a selfish wretch but did it never strike you that if Heathcliff and I married, we should be beggars whereas, if I marry Linton I can aid Heathcliff to rise, and place him out of my brother s power. Love is selfish Most of the forms of love which are depicted between the different characters in this novel are self centred and generally ignore the needs and feelings of others. What is paramount is the importance of the lover s own needs and feelings I have nearly attained my heaven and that of others is altogether unvalued and uncovered by me. Love is an addiction My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff He s always, always in my mind not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being. So don t talk of our separation again it is impracticable and This is a brilliantly brave and brutal work of fiction. It bewitches the reader, casting a spell on us and turning us into misanthropists, for the only way to keep one s sanity in the face of this violent and destructive force is isolation I m now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.

"54","Wuthering Heights"," 25, 2013 Emma","it was amazing"," My goodness it s all a bit dramatic, isn t it Be warned, this book contains high flights of passion, jealous fits, desperate love, exasperating characters, and a brooding and degraded Heathcliff who I don t fancy by the way . C est Fantastique I do love Wuthering Heights and for reasons unknown my eye was drawn to it for a re read. This book is a messy business and I guess the.....oh I dunno.....the crushing depression of it all pierces my emotional wall. The relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff is central to the novel and it s the type of unhealthy love that makes you feel like your whole body, mind, everything is all twisted up, like your organs are shrivelling up inside, and every part of you wants to cry out in desperation, which Cathy does, frequently. I cannot express it but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is, or should be an existence of yours beyond you. What were the use of creation if I were entirely contained here My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff s miseries, and I watched and felt each from the beginning my great thought in living is himself. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the Universe would turn to a mighty stranger I should not seem a part of it.I don t believe in much.....ethereal stuff....I believe what I can see, what I can touch, what can be proven, but as a teenager I could almost believe that tragic love, la Heathcliff and Cathy, could transcend the common destiny of all human beings. Yeah right. This isn t a romantic tale, it s a cautionary tale, run screaming from any man or woman that reminds you of Heathcliff or Cathy Shuttering yourself away into the darkness of seclusion because of an obsessive love never works out well. The gloominess of the novel still appeals to me as does the setting of the Yorkshire Moors. I ve never been to the North of England but I did spend large chunks of my childhood in Brittany, and whilst the landscape isn t really the same, I don t think, it is vast with green rolling hills and wild expanses. I am reminded of my childhood, of rural isolation, when I read the descriptions of the countryside in Wuthering Heights, and that is a happy thing. My inside voice found Joseph s broad Yorkshire accent he s the elderly gardener at Wuthering Heights almost impossible to articulate. Whet is thur tuh do, nah What is there to do now Peasy. We s hae a Crahnr s quest enah, at ahr folks. One on em s a most getten his finger cut off wi hauding t other froo sticking hisseln loike a cawlf. Huh Has somebody s finger been cut off I probably skimmed over Joseph s 19th century Northern speak the first time round but I wanted to have some comprehension of what I was reading. Google helped me here and threw up a general glossary of dialectal words, although I have no idea how accurate this glossary is and I would never ever attempt to read these parts out loud to anyone. I love the diversity of women writers from this period, the Brontes, Mary Shelly, Elizabeth Gaskell, Charlotte Mary Yonge, Dinah Craik.... the range from sensationalism to serious social comment, popular to masterpiece is amazing. Wuthering Heights in my mind is a lasting masterpiece and with its romance, fantasy and gothic overtones it is one of my favourite books. Oh, and gulping down Wuthering Heights in four days gave me MENTAL dreams. "

Y es un libro requerido para muchas lecturas universitarias, en mi caso el curso de literatura inglesa del siglo XIX. Bien ah .Las hermanas Br nte fueron un grupo de hermanas escritoras que vivieron durante la poca victoriana y como era com n en la poca, murieron muy j venes a causa de la tuberculosis. Las tres hermanas que sobrevivieron la infancia fueron Emily, Charlotte y Anne que publicaron sus escritos bajo los pseud nimos de Ellis, Currer y Acton Bell pr ctica muy com n en la poca por su condici n de mujeres . Emily Br nte tambi n fue poetisa y m s de un a o antes de su muerte logr publicar esta novela, su nica obra y nunca supo el reconocimiento que alcanzar a. Emily muri de 30 a os pero esta obra se considera una de las m s importantes escritoras de las letras inglesas.Los p ramos helados de Yorkshire son el escenario de fondo en esta novela en la que naturaleza es muy importante para el desarrollo de la historia. En 1801, el se or Lockwood llega a visitar a su casero, quien resulta siendo un hombre muy grosero llamado Heathcliff. Intrigado, decide averiguar por qu es as . Y en la voz de la ama de llaves Nelly Dean, conocer la historia que sucedi m s de 30 a os antes en esos mismos parajes. La gran casa llamada Wuthering Heights Cumbres borrascosas es la casa de la familia Earnshaw, una familia pr spera en la que viven Hindley y su hermana Catherine. Cerca de all , est la casa llamada Thrushcross Grange, hogar de la familia Linton en la que viven Edgar y su hermana Isabella. La historia inicia en la ni ez de todos estos chicos, cuando el se or Earnshaw regresa de un viaje trayendo una sorpresa para sus hijos desde Liverpool trajo a un ni o sucio con apariencia de gitano, al que bautizan Heathcliff. No se crean Heathcliff es de ojos oscuros pero es que Ralph Fiennes...Esta novela es infinitamente interesante y tiene much simos pies para sacarle. No s lo es que era una novela con una estructura inusual para su poca contiene una historia dentro de una historia dentro de unas narraciones de otras voces , sino que es una de las historias m s conocidas gracias su multitud de adaptaciones al cine, teatro y televisi n. Nelly Dean es una ama de llaves es la que va cont ndole al se or Lockwood el pasado de las familias que habitaron esas zonas de los fr os paramos de Yorkshire. Una historia de dos familias enfrentadas y con personajes polares que se enfrentan entre lo bueno, lo malo, el amor y el odio. Esta novela es una donde los sentimientos se llevan al extremo. La pasi n, el amor, la venganza, el odio y la violencia... todo est incre blemente magnificado. Imaginen lo que esta novela supuso en su momento. No s lo lo bien descrito de los pasajes m s evocadores y las escenas donde estas pasiones y sentimientos humanos son representados al extremo. Es una novela que no tarda en despertar odio, fastidio y hasta horror en sus pasajes y por sus personajes. Para muchos, son despreciables. Una de las cosas m s interesantes de esta historia es lo polares de sus personajes. Todos los personajes representan un extremo frente a sus semejantes en la historia. Empecemos por partes Hindley es el heredero de la familia Earnshaw y se lleva bien con su hermana Catherine hasta que Heathcliff llega a sus vidas. El primer desarrolla una aversi n por el ni o que es diferente y por eso no duda en hacerle la vida imposible. Tenemos el desprecio por el otro. Catherine es un ni a que se cr a caprichosa y malcriada y encuentra en Heathcliff un semejante con el que compartir su naturaleza impulsiva. Pero al mimos tiempo l tiene una personalidad opuesta a la de ella y por eso sus actitudes y pensamientos no tardan en chocar. Y obviamente hay que referirse a Edgar Linton un joven calmado y sereno, tan contrario a Heathcliff e Isabella, una joven ingenua que Cathy no tarda en desagradarle. Ralph se borda un papel n como HeathcliffLa relaci n de Heathcliff y Catherine est muy bien descrita en la novela aunque se nos cuente desde una tercera persona. Nelly no es la narradora m s fiable del mundo y da la impresi n que hay cosas que no sabemos a ciencia cierta. Pero a trav s de sus ojos podemos distinguir que es una relaci n de amor ora enfermizo, ora incondicional pero que es parte vital del desarrollo de toda la historia. No es una relaci n sana pero es una que Catherine describe como es una piedra bajo los rboles, que siempre estar ahi fija y segura . A pesar de los diferentes que eran, no pod an evitar sentirse tra dos el uno por el otro.Pero hablemos de la narraci n. Yo lo le en ingl s y hay que decir que hay unas partes bastante complicadas de leer por cierto personaje llamado Joseph que me hac a la vida imposible. Porque se come las letras, un a palabras y solo dice cosas que est n en la Biblia. Se supone que la intenci n de Emily era reproducir la forma de hablar de Yorkshire. Pero bueno exceptuando estas partes est muy bien escrito, pero no es f cil de leer si no tienes ya un bagaje. Con esa estructura a base de testimonio en su mayor a y en algunos otros momentos intervenciones de otros narradores, tenemos una novela que puede ser susceptible a otras interpretaciones. Esta es una novela familiar marcada por la tragedia y las decisiones malas o buenas que los personajes realizan, adem s de esos pasajes que te dejan con una opresi n en el pecho, que les pongo una frase que me dejaron sin habla My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff He s more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same. I cannot live without my life I cannot live without my soul Es una novela absolutamente oscura, llena de pasiones desenfrenadas, odio, secretos, amor incluso algo de esperanza. Y su contraparte on rica y de horror es absolutamente cautivante. Es una historia familiar llena de escenas impresionantes, bien contadas y llenas de un dramatismo humano muy potente. No puedo decir m s que cosas buenas de esta historia y que es una novela absolutamente indispensable si te gusta la literatura. Y que ya forma parte DE MIS LIBROS FAVORITOS DE TODOS LOS TIEMPOS. "

Wuthering Heights, always beloved by me for its dark I adore good monster stories. Wuthering Heights is one of the best. When I lived in Ukraine, I spent a stormy, tragic couple of weeks gazing out over the snow covered steppes of the East and reading Bram Stoker s Dracula. I became so absorbed in the drama and mystery of what happens when the British accidentally try to sell real estate to the undead that I didn t want to abandon that atmosphere even after I had finished Jonathan Harker s tale. Wuthering Heights, always beloved by me for its dark star crossedness, was the obvious solution. Immediately as I started rereading the novel, however, I realized how similar Wuthering Heights is to Dracula, and that is how it became my favorite vampire story.Initially, the structure of the two books inspired the comparison. A man, alone in a strange land, becomes trapped in the home of a sadistic and suspicious looking host and writes a diary about the rumors of his host s history. Both journals seem deliciously tainted and unreliable, but somehow still able to uncover something resonant about the monstrosity of humans. Both demonic hosts are the victims of desire that cannot be quenched desire that has grown murderous. Both hosts have female counterparts that are way more scary and evil than themselves. And spoiler both stories have suspiciously tidy endings that don t even come close to redeeming the ruination of most of the characters. So excellent I am not arguing that Emily Bronte intended this story as a straightforward vampire tale. The essence, however, of any vampire story is an exploration of the need to live by the death of others. Bronte masterfully illustrates that as a fundamentally human flaw. In the ways that Heathcliff is more monstrous than Linton, he is also more human.I m not going to lie to you. What I really love about this book is not its narrative structure, deep message about the human condition, or window into 19th century life on the moors. I become absolutely weak kneed at the moment in this story when Heathcliff overhears Catherine insulting him to Nelly and then takes off into the night. It is irony at its finest. I pretty much swoon when Heathcliff returns for the passionate moment before the birth of young Catherine. I am in love, for better or worse, with the doomed and unrealistic passion of Heathcliff and Catherine. I have loved this book for long enough that I think it s safe to say I will always feel that way.I would probably not invite Catherine and Heathcliff to a quiet afternoon of poetry and wine tasting, but they would definitely get an e vite from me to a rockin New Years Eve. Those two and unsuspecting civilians throw in some cheese and crackers and that s a party. I might e vite Sarah Michelle Gellar, just in case things got out of hand, but I would definitely stick around to see what would happen next. A little sadistic hosting of my own. Bwahaha.Usually, when I hear this story criticized, it is for how evil both Heathcliff and Catherine are. While I would never dispute that, it is exactly what I love about Wuthering Heights. They are monsters, but still somewhat sympathetic, and in some ways I want them to find satisfaction. Unquestionably, they deserve and even seek out all the torment they get, and though I don t wish that torment on them I am positively mesmerized by it. They are not merely silly and petty, like the lovers in so many books, they are villains. They are something more extreme than anti heroes. "
"58","Wuthering Heights"," 12, 2016 Gary the Bookworm","it was amazing"," Revised review 7 12 16I first read Wuthering Heights after discovering the films of literary classics from Hollywood s Golden Age. I remember being swept away by Olivier and Oberon, watching them smolder on a 19 TV set in the basement of my college dormitory back in 1972. I waited until summer vacation to pick up the novel, but I was still under the contagion of Hollywood s romanticism, so I preferred the film. My Jane Austen obsession was in its early stages and I found the desolate, wild Yorkshire moors less hospitable than the cultivated gardens and drawing room banter of Pride and Prejudice. The unremitting malevolence of Heathcliff, without the amelioration of Olivier s preening presence, unsettled me. Last week, I completed The Bront s, the wonderful biography of the Bronte family and decided to immerse myself in their novels, starting with Emily s opus. Reading about her short and peculiar life did not adequately prepare me for the chilling impact of revisiting Wuthering Heights. The opening chapter is as frightening as anything found in the gothic or horror genres. Bronte manages to shock, expostulate and instruct in a narrative that is compelling, repugnant, and never dull. She is able to imbue the environment with an eerie mix of awesome beauty and incipient menace. Catherine and Heathcliff embody a passion which is unsustainable and unnatural her betrayal leads to his necromantic megalomania. It isn t until the epilogue that Bronte offers a glimpse of the promise of love without remorse. According to her biographer, she was influenced by Walter Scott and the juvenile scribblings by herself and her siblings. It isn t much of a stretch to argue that she inspired works by Melville, Hardy and Tolstoy. Just think what this obscure recluse might have produced if she d lived past 30. Original review As much as I admire the work of Jane Austen, I take comfort in the knowledge that another great novelist from the 19th Century was foraging in the muck to produce this saga. It is a bit of a slog at first, but once you get comfortable with her style of writing, you are in for a hair raising adventure. Imagine Jane Austen on acid view spoiler hide spoiler Emily had a horrific imagination and she wasn t afraid to show it. After all these years Wuthering Heights still packs a punch. I wonder if anyone will be reading Twilight in 2112. "
"59","Wuthering Heights"," 10, 2015 Laz","it was amazing"," I was somewhat perplexed when deciding on the rating of this book. It starts off amazingly and interestingly but halfway I kind of lost interest because there was lots of hate and it kind of makes you sad to see that there could ever be so much hate into one s heart. But I got on with it and I am glad I did because the last 40 pages are worth all of the hate that us, the readers, and the characters underwent. ... How any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth. Partly, the 5 stars are because of this line. I mean, it s just so beautiful that it made me feel at peace. I can t help but sympathize with Heathcliff because his hate and malice was somewhat justified considering all that he went through during his childhood and then his later years being treated like a halfling and then losing the love of his life twice, the second one being to death.

"61","Wuthering Heights"," 06, 2016 Jean","did not like it"," Vastly overrated hysterical nonsense. One feels there is a good novel in there somewhere, and a more experienced writer might have been more successful. There are Gothic elements which could have been explored, characters who deserved to be more fully fleshed out the only believable character is the narrator, the servant Nellie Dean and surely a world outside the two houses and their navel gazing inmates, which is never mentioned. Not to mention incredibly complicated time shifts and an unnecessary flashback structure which only serves to distract the reader from the plot. As if 3 generations of similarly named characters were not difficult enough to keep track of all the Haretons, Hindleys, Heathcliffe Was Emily disappointed in love, one wonders let down by a suitor named H much as Jane Austen had been by her W But I digress. This much lauded mastery of an extremely complex structure as one critic will have it seems to me extremely amateurish. Every so often, the author recollects that the narrator is an actual character, and breaks off at a random moment to bring the reader back to the present. Irritating.I find myself wondering why this novel attracts so much adoration from modern readers. Is it because it is the only novel by the middle one of the Bront sisters The one who died tragically young, blah di blah di blah Has it just been lumped with all the Haworth hyperbole I find all the Bront trio deficient when compared with the sheer breadth of compass of many other 19th Century writers, and Emily seems by far the weakest. In fact I ve suspected for a long time that because the Parsonage at Haworth the family home and many of their childhood artefacts still exist, this may be almost entirely responsible for firing the public s imagination. Maybe a lot of the self absorption of the writers and their characters can be attributed to the fact that the Bront s water supply ran through the graveyard. This in itself must be enough to make anyone feel unwell and inclined to emote all the time. Cathy surely needed a good slap. In fact most of the characters agonising may have mysteriously disappeared if they d only had something to DO Now I m revealing my origins fully Yorkshire Protestant Work Ethic . Every decade or so I have taken this down from the bookshelf to give it another chance. Never again. It has now been consigned for ever more to someone else s. May they have joy of it.

"63","Wuthering Heights"," 18, 2014 Jennifer aka EM","it was amazing"," This novel is such an accomplishment. Emily Bront , you ROCK.I say this, even though page for page, my heart and soul belong with Charlotte specifically, Jane Eyre and Villette. They are more of a match for me and who I am. Yet I admire and am astounded by Emily s talent. That admiration comes from now knowing the broader context of her life thank you, Juliet Barker and your masterful The Bront s . I certainly didn t feel it the first time through WH, when I dismissed the achievement because of the over the top plotting and characterization. It just seemed so far fetched way back when just not my thing. Yet on re reading, I was unable to distance myself from the characters, as extreme as they are. I don t see them, now, as unrealistic in fact, they are all too real. I felt a powerful revulsion for them and especially, for the child abuse. Meaning, I felt both repulsed by their bad behaviour and also sympathetic for the abuse they experienced that made that behaviour all the more likely, and all the more tragic.I literally had spasms of anger course through me towards the end. On many occasions, I contemplated whether to stop reading I found it so painful. There s a nature nurture theme here that I don t think Emily got quite right. She did not differentiate well enough the different scenarios and their effects on character. Basically, all the nasty pieces of work were nasty in the same ways, despite various combinations of inborn temperament and parenting environment.But even to tackle it a woman who had about three years of formal schooling and had travelled just barely more than the younger Cathy had by age 13 is such an impressive feat. And even if you peel away that unnecessary thematic layer, the drama of the story and characters stand. The miracle of a woman like Emily Bront creating this thing that is 100 a product of her own imagination stands. As she herself says, through her housekeeper storyteller and how clever is THAT I certainly esteem myself a steady, reasonable kind of body not exactly from living among the hills, and seeing one set of faces, and one series of actions, from year s end to year s end but I have undergone sharp discipline which has taught me wisdom and then, I have read more than you would fancy . Virginia Woolf, in A Room Of Ones Own, questioned why the Bront s and Eliot and Austen, too wrote novels. Why the novel She saw Emily, had she lived or lived in different times, as a dramatic playwright as potentially transcendent as Shakespeare. So do I.I am still beyond pissed at Charlotte for destroying Emily s second novel after her death. I love you, Charlotte it s your behaviour I dislike. And or so , I haven t yet read her forward to the second edition of WH published after Emily s death, included in my Oxford World Classics copy, along with a selection of Emily s poems and some reasonably competent end notes.Barker s assumption is that Charlotte ultimately deemed Emily s second novel inappropriate for what novels should be which, Charlotte believed, was what would be marketable and what would preserve and protect the integrity and reputation of the sisters. see comment 2 below for more fulsome explanation But Emily didn t give a fig about what the neighbours or the public at large thought. She had access to the richest, most colourful, most interesting, most stimulating world close at hand, not within or close by the four walls of the Haworth Parsonage, but within her own imagination. Nothing else was relevant to her.She didn t need the society of others but for her siblings and her beloved dog, Keeper she didn t need instruction or exposure to ideas beyond the large library she had at hand she didn t need the stimulation or activities available in a city, because she had wild nature all around her. And most of all, she had an ever expanding world within her own brain, with none of the limits imposed by mid 19th century Yorkshire or what anyone thought of her or her writing. Wuthering Heights is a matured version of the juvenilia specifically, the Gondal world where Emily s imagination, her life and her soul, lived. Enter it with her whether you like that world or not whether you are drawn to it or want to revisit it whether you respond to its characters or its themes is irrelevant, she will make you feel it. Wuthering Heights is Emily s brain on a page. She didn t create a world and send it out to the reader through the mundane conduit of publication, as much as she opened a door to her soul and invited the reader in. That said, she did write and publish it, pouring out her thoughts strange and dark and disconnected but not really from the outside world an alternate universe, but a universal and lasting legacy in a novel her only one and one that remains in print and among the very best of a century of best novels. Transcendent. Shakespearean. Emily Bront .Believe it. "
"64","Wuthering Heights"," 31, 2011 Shovelmonkey1","it was amazing"," As a youth I was very resilient to classic literature. Why The reasons I would now give are as follows 1. It was written a long time ago and therefore in my yoof mind which FYI was a tight nucleus of hormones surrounded by a swirling miasma of rage it was the book equivalent of black and white TV dated, not relevant and generally unappealing to the eyes. 2. My teachers raved about it. Nothing is guaranteed to make you bang your head against the blackboard more than a dishevelled English Literature teacher swooning, flailing and waxing lyrical about open shirted, brooding hero types.3. Oldy worldy verboseness. Obviously most of us here at Goodreads are now embroiled in a torrid love affair with wordiness in general. We all clatter away at our keyboards, directing our day to day verbosity at a medium which allows us an outlet for all the words we have broiling in a big word soup inside our heads but which many people outside of this cosy niche in cyberspace are not interested in listening to , however Georgian verboseness or even Victorian period verboseness represented a sort of textual turgidity to me.4. Belligerence. The world thinks these books are a heart breaking work of staggering genius. I therefore, will not.Anyway, it s been a good few years since I left school, probably more than I care to admit and while I still retain elements of both the hormonal and belligerent aspects described above, I ve finally made my peace with classic lit. Prior to reaching this zen like state of literary understanding, I d always had a little corner of my book soul reserved for the exception that is Wuthering Heights.Wuthering Heights is good. It is even good when you re a teenager because it is a never ending cycle of bleak. A bit like being a teenager. It fed into my inner EMO, well at least that s my excuse.Everything about this novel is bleak. Bleak, bleak, bleak. The moors, the house, the squalid, damp, mouldering self destructive hatred of the people brought about by intense jealousy, sibling rivalry and the great social experiment which is nature versus nurture coupled with the bleak doomed to fail love of Cathy and Heathcliff. The story examines the slow decay of a once prosperous family, which could be directly attributed to presence of the cuckoo in the nest the family fortunes and relations begin to deteriorate following Heathcliff s arrival . Heathcliff is regarded as another romantic ultimate, much like Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice he has come to define a type of man. The unobtainable, dark and brooding figure the sort that certain ladies see as a challenge . Someone to be caught and domesticated but all the while admired for his good looks. Immortalised on the silver screen and by mad as a box of frogs singer Kate Bush. A gothic soap opera on a grand scale and also a gentle reminder that its grim up north "
"65","Wuthering Heights"," 01, 2014 Stephanie","it was ok"," Oh the drama Today, with all the ridiculous reality shows, I thought this time period had the corner on drama. But I was wrong. We don t hold a candle to the drama during the mid 1800s.Maybe I m not sophisticated enough to see the greatness in this book. This is the second classic I ve read where I don t seem to see the charm. I thought Heathcliff and Catherine were supposedly a great love story kind of couple. But Heathcliff was an asshole from his childhood on, mean, angry and violent, I don t understand what Cathy could have seen in him. And Cathy was so self absorbed I m not sure how she even noticed him at all I m confused.There s even a song with a crazy video that convinced me it was a great love story Why did you lie to me Kate Kate Bush was singing to me in my head the whole time I was reading this, by the way. In fact, I don t think I ve ever read a book where every character in it was so thoroughly unlikable. I wanted to set fire to Wuthering Heights and the whole lot and just walk away. I hated everyone in it. The narrator, Nelly Dean, seems to have an amazing recall. Astounding She tells the entire tale to Mr. Lockwood, a tenant of Mr. Heathcliff s while he is bedridden with an illness, Everyone is bedridden with an illness at some point in this book, ah . The pre penicillin days. with total recall, including entire conversations. This was not only unbelievable but it didn t really work with the flow. I had to keep remembering that it was Nelly telling the story. Odd. Oh, and bad things happened to dogs....I don t like that.Wuthering Heights was not at all what I was expecting and I m fairly certain I missed the point. "

And I read it a third time after a horrible breakup, the one that broke my heart, right before I turned 30.I was in a different frame of mind for each reading and, yet, every single time, I finished with the same response I hate this book.I actively hate it. I want all the damnable characters to get a terrible influenza that is so painful and horrific that they suffer terribly, losing their voices so they can t whine about every little thing they love to whine about, and then they die, alone, far from the windowpanes where they ve scratched all their nonsense, far from the moors that contain weather matching their moods and space to match the emptiness in their souls, far from the moneybags they have hidden under floorboards or in vaults or wherever they keep all their ill gotten gains ill gotten because I hate this story and want to defame it I want them all to be lonesome, forgotten ghosts. All of them.Ugh.And those moors Everyone else makes them sound wild and magical, harsh but mystical. This book makes them sound damp, cold...solitary, nasty, brutish, and gross, etc. Why so much unlove for the heather ridden, scraggly, rocky, yet somehow verdant hills Because nothing in this book is nice. Not people, not nature, nothing. It is all one big lump of unpleasant drama. If this were updated, there would be Kardashians in this story. But, Erica, you don t generally like nice so what gives This is too much not nice even for me. EVEN FOR ME That s a lot of not nice.I ll read this book again someday...when I have dementia and forget that I hate it. "

"69","Wuthering Heights"," 27, 2016 Vani","it was amazing"," Emily Bronte s Wuthering Heights is painfully sad and exciting. It is not merely a tale of wild, vindictive love, but more than that, it depicts a way of life as it existed in the Victorian times the double standards, the hypocrisy, the subjugation of women and their second grade treatment as if they were mere appendages to men. The way it juxtaposes passion with hatred, human depravity with moral values, peace with strife is absolutely remarkable. To think that the author was only in her twenties when she wrote it seriously, it is so difficult to imagine that.The narrative revolves around two families who live on the moors the Earnshaws of the Wuthering Heights and the Lintons of the Thrushcross Grange. Catherine Earnshaw of Wuthering Heights is in love with Heathcliff, an orphan boy who was picked up by her father from the streets of Liverpool. Later as Catherine decides to marry Edgar Linton of Thrushcross Grange, Heathcliff is heartbroken and vengeful. He is not to be found for three years and when he returns he comes to know that his childhood sweetheart is not only married but is expecting a child from Edgar. That s the agonising start of Heathcliff s revenge and one that will lead him to destroy everything, including himself. Even though the novel has been written from the point of view of a servant who worked with the Earnshaws and then the Lintons, it is explosive in the way it brings out Heathcliff s agony and hatred against all those who have wronged him. Here s something he says to his own son What a shame of your mother, never to waken your filial regard for me You are my son, then, I ll tell you and your mother was a wicked slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed. Now, don t wince, and colour up Though it is something to see you have not white blood. Be a good lad and I ll do for you. I think this book is going to stay with me a long, long time. Do read it, folks "
"70","Wuthering Heights"," 20, 2016 Chris P","it was amazing"," This isn t just a book. This is a blast of literary brilliance One thing I really appreciate in films series books is when they give the viewer reader the in your face treatment. When they tell a story with no cellophanes and colorful icings. Bronte does exactly that. Is it a story about love Well, it is a story that includes love. Just like real life. And just like in real life, the quality of love is peculiar to those who practice it. So, I d say Wuthering Heights is a story about weak characters consumed by their own selfishness and emptiness that drives them to lead meaningless lives. Of course they have no idea that their lives are devoid of meaning. But what kind of meaning is there in a life dedicated in revenge and malice The reader follows most of the characters from their childhood, so one can see exactly what went wrong. And that is the reason why one can sympathize with them, even in their most hateful actions. There is no clear line which separates good from evil. You don t really get to hate Heathcliff because although his actions are unjustifiable, you know why he acts like that. You ve seen what made him that. He is a deranged, degenerate person, so what kind of love could come from him When he loses the one person that could bring out all that s good in him, is it any wonder that he lets his good side die with her Heathcliff is like a virus infecting everything and everyone he touches. The final element is that even in the most rotten soil, a flower can bloom given that the time is right and the will of the seed is strong. Stronger than whatever it is that eats what otherwise would be good and fertile.That s when a pen can make wonders... "

"73","Wuthering Heights"," 21, 2015 Julie","really liked it"," It was hard not to compare this book to Jane Eyre, for the simple reason that these are both classics written by sisters. I had put both off for years thinking they would be too much of a challenge, and after finally reading JE earlier this year, and ranking it a top favorite of all time, I knew I wanted to read WH and am so glad I did. I don t think the two novels can even be compared, and what I enjoyed about this one was not having read the blurb going in.It was a challenging read at times, due to the naming of the numerous characters that were almost impossible for me to keep track of without the use of a family tree Everything about this book is dark and dismal. The unlikable and selfish characters that were perfect for each other make irrational decisions, and the story evolves around a relationship that is developed out of spite, and will affect the next generation of families as well. It made me wonder more about the author and what inspired her to write a book about such a dysfunctional family, especially given the time it was written. The story is not so much a love story as it is one of passion and obsession. It was an absorbing read, and one that I am still processing, mostly, regarding whether the character Heathcliff was sympathetic. For all his actions of hatred and revenge, I can t help but wonder if he is sympathetic for all the suffering, scarring, and torment he endured. I loved the way his character was developed in spite of his evil traits. I think this is a book that is either loved or hated but if you like gothic romance, the moors, a touch of the paranormal, and even reading about dysfunctional families and unlikable characters, this classic is well worth the read.

I love the fact that this story is written like a story within a story, and I love how we get to follow the main characters from they re little children till the last years of their lives. You would assume that would make them more lovable to the reader since we get to follow them through everything, but NO I m still puzzled as to how I feel about Catherine and Heathcliff. They are both so nasty and selfish, but at the same time it ached my heart to hear of Heathcliff s destiny in the end. I love the fact that Emily Bront plays with her hero and hero ne in such a way she manages to makes them unlovable as well as loveable and I don t know how This is a victorian novel and I think it reads best during autumn. I was at times confused at all the characters and their names Emily Bront oftentimes calls her characters by first their last name, then their first name. I was also frustrated by the fact that I didn t understand a word of what Joseph said. But all in all, this is a masterpiece that plays with your mind and makes you wonder what makes a character lovable or unlovable "
"75","Wuthering Heights"," 22, 2015 Elham Kharidar","really liked it"," Dear reader who hasn t read Whuthering Heights yet,It is not a love story. It is a horrible epic. The love of Heathcliff for Catherine is one of the most destructive passions that one can see in literature. Heathcliff who could do anything for his love can be a symbol of greedy and senseless people who are ready to victimize everything and everybody for their certain goals. In this novel hatred and inferiority complex are at their maximum level. One sided judgment and cruelty over people have their most appealing reason Love. One thing that made this novel very much readable is the power of the author herself to show these negative but humanly weak points in a very strong style that makes Heathcliff an unforgettable character. The next time you find yourself in the stage of being self centered and unfair about other people remember Heathcliff. But be careful that he was a blind lover whilst for most of our irrationalities we are not lovers "
"76","Wuthering Heights"," 16, 2011 KatLynne","it was amazing"," Finished my re read today and what I had forgotten about this novel is brilliance . How often do we find an author who can make your heart bleed with tenderness and compassion for a character while only a few chapters later, your greatest desire is to thrash said character in the throes of anger. And the remarkable thing is that while you are wanting to hurt him in some measure to convey your dislike for his dastardly deeds, still inside and trying to lure its way to the forefront of your emotion is the initial tenderness and compassion. Does that make any sense at all Wuthering Heights is a tale of despair, revenge and of love. It is a Gothic novel. Knowing this going in, I still had forgotten the extent of the darkness and how much despair fill its pages. It follows the life of orphaned Heathcliff and his adoptive family the Earnshaws and his revenge against the two families the Earnshaws Lintons who have wronged him and his love hate relationship with Catherine Earnshaw. And make no mistake that these two do love each other and often, hatred and anger is temporarily their emotion of choice. At this point of the review, we could stop and expound on all the many elements or merits of the underlying themes meanings found. We could spend many paragraphs pages discussing the brilliance there s that word again by this author s use of the calendar and lunar phases to mark the passage of time or her great knowledge and use of the law to achieve certain objectives. We could even bring forth some of the many questions put about since its publication ..Did Heathcliff and Catherine love each other as man wife or more like twins ...Do we know for sure that Heathcliff was not the biological son of Catherine s father, Mr. Earnshaw ...there are so many But in this review, it is simply my love hate relationship with this book and a brief summary of my thoughts. The story takes place between Wuthering Heights, a remote moorland farmhouse belonging to the generations of Earnshaws and Thrushcross Grange, a beautiful mansion owned through the generations of the Lintons, both located in a remote corner of West Yorkshire. The story is told through the housekeeper, Mrs. Ellen Dean. She is relaying the facts to Mr. Lockwood, a recent tenant of Thrushcross Grange. And the characters are only those related in these two families, with very few outside included. WH follows two generations. The novel begins with Mr. Mrs. Earnshaw and their children, Hindley Catherine. Heathcliff is brought into the Earnshaw home by Mr. Earnshaw, who while visiting London found him homeless, about seven years old and living on the streets. Having pity on this dirty, hungry bedraggled gypsy looking boy, he brings him into the Earnshaw fold and treats him like one of his children. Later on, this creates such animosity between Earnshaw s son, Hindley that his future treatment of Heathcliff is nearly unforgivable. And hatred is born in Heathcliff that will only be released through revenge.We soon meet the other family involved in this story. The Linton s along with their children, Edgar Isabella. Mr. Mrs. Earnshaw have both died and now Hindley Earnshaw is in charge of the household. His hatred for Heathcliff is no secret and he bans him from any family activity. He cannot eat or play with Catherine. Hindley intends to show Heathcliff that his place is as a servant and not a family member. Heath is mistreated and shamed often. The anguish and grief this causes Heathcliff and Catherine is palpable. Edgar Linton is the exact opposite of Heathcliff pale skin, refined, scholarly rich and from a prominent family. Both The Linton s and Hindley feel a good match would be made between Edgar and Catherine. One evening, after overhearing a conversation by Catherine, Heathcliff s very soul seems crushed and he is filled with shame. Heathcliff now realizes that he doesn t measure up to society s standards he s not good enough or clean enough not rich enough and not scholarly enough. We are dumped into the depths of Heath s despair and hatred. Crushed with hurt, he leaves Wuthering Heights, returning a few years later, more educated, refined and also rich. Catherine has made choices she now regrets or that has brought consequences she did not foresee. Both Heath s and Catherine s hearts and spirit will be broken. Despair is encapsulated on every page Heartache follows. There is death. Despair Cruelty And in the midst of great pain and torment, Heathcliff never looses sight of revenge. And now Edgar Linton is added to his destructive path. And maybe his heartache was so great, he needed this focus to face each day. Heathcliff s revenge will seek its completion with the next generation Cathy Linton Hareton Earnshaw and Linton Heathcliff. Isabella Linton is used and discarded without a blink or a thought of remorse. Heathcliff s decision to cause pain and exact his revenge on his enemies and their children is the focus of his days. And this is the life and goal for Heath for many,many years. Now, his goal is in sight total revenge is at hand. And then a remarkable thing happens and revenge doesn t seem to be his mainstay. Something or someone is drawing him away from his cruelty and his focus is diverted. He cannot eat nor sleep. Whether in the moors or at home, it s as if he is searching .and seeing .What could it be and is it enough to stop the destructive path of revenge to end his days of anguish to stop the heart wrenching despair and loneliness Will a reprieve be had and allow the last of the Earnshaw s and the last of the Linton s to unite A hauntingly, brilliant, passionate love story full of obsession, despair, and revenge that draws you into the heart, keeps you there, and when done, never to forget Heathcliff or Catherine s story. And this is why I state I have a love hate relationship with this novel. I have used the word despair often in this review. For me, it s the underlying theme word. I dislike Gothic novels, but I loved this one I hate despair, but I could not stop reading this one I hated Heathcliff, but I loved him so very much also A brilliant work Memoriable Quote view spoiler May she wake in torment he cried, with frightful vehemence, stamping his foot, and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion.

"77","Wuthering Heights"," 01, 2016 Waqas","it was amazing"," This is so irrelevant to the book. view spoiler The pristine thorns of love unfurl the tragedies inherent in us as they make us bleed, and remain aloft with their pride and superstition. The intensity of holding the fluttering emotions is so still as a stagnant water which is ever so prone to drowning our oblique existence fluctuating between the ecstasy and torment. Absurdity wraps itself in silky illusions when our insatiable impulses are satiated by the supernatural repose churning in the pools of a heart ablaze with infatuation each spark ensuing the cold kiss of frosty separation, each flame extinguished in the rueful tempest. Yet this ignition never flares.She never told her loveBut let concealment, like worm i the bud,Feed on her damask cheek How we shrunk beholding the rearing loftiness of Wuthering Heights catering our fears with its latched doors guarding the slumbering secrets of past and future like the Janus, and smoldering walls hiding the passions too immense, vengeances perpetually intoxicated, and sufferings increasingly augmented all of it further escalated by our prejudiced curiosity. Franz Liszt once described Beethoven s delicate second movement of Moonlight Sonata as a flower between two chasms , which inculcates a striking harmony with the feisty Catherine s episode, the daughter, blooming between the haunting memories and impending chaos that will completely change her life. A chaos of Catherine s love for Heathcliff, which singles out our every possible infatuation, and infantilizes them into demure sleet trickling away beneath their seething footsteps of love. Can we follow them with our marginal sustainability We too fragile to endure, this chilly wind over moorlands and heath. Though Earth and Moon were goneAnd suns and universe ceased to beAnd thou were left aloneEvery existence would exist in thee Relinquishing the grasp of reality, attaining one in the superstition of death the embers in the hearth his only warmth, and the whole world becomes a black void of oblivion as it shimmered as the pupil of his eye. Heathcliff s soul turns into steel. Brittle with pain and sufferings, opaque towards the any perception of worldly mitigation. The endless deferral of solace insinuates in him the ambiance of obsession and cruelty impregnating the fantasies replete with impossible. The juxtaposition of dreams and reality, the wild and tender, and of his emotions in chaos against the solid composure of his body, delineate the dissonance of clashing notions never meant to reconcile but always remaining in limbo for their fatalistic yearning of harmonization. Sleep brings no joy to meRemembrance never diesMy only wish is to forgetIn the sleep of death The rebellion for a transcendent peace and its impending attainment pulsate throughout the story the fugitive summers are idealized in the perpetual winters, transforming the earthly bliss into celestial sanctuaries, the song of lark echoing a heavenly lullaby, dismantled senses assuaged by the vestiges of childhood. A mad impulse constantly propelled to parish oneself in the soothing soil, to cut off Ariadne s thread with scorn, to destroy one s own flesh so incapable of encompassing the sufferings and joys inherent, for any mortal outlet has shrunk too narrow for the astronomical ecstasies to escape. An endless delirium for salvation augmented by the imprisonment of insatiable, frustrated, demonic soul. A collision of disenchantment and idealization her idea of Heathchilf becomes too remote and divine, too hers to be held in her defiled existence. And their legend continue to haunt those who roam the wild moorlands of Wuthering Heights, who curl in the despair of solitude and thumb these pages with great delight.

I didn t expected to hate and love so much those characters. Well, at first I thought that I would adore them. And then I ended up resenting them, wondering how I even wanted their happiness in the first place. But I ended up with a glint of tenderness for both of them while closing the last page.Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff are the two most flawed character I have ever read about. They are selfish, mean to everyone even each other , vain, childish and so many more flaws. They first met when Catherine s father adopt Heathcliff. He stayed a long time in the streets and don t really know how to behave in society, he is dirty and not well educated. Catherine takes little time before considering him as family but her brother, Hindley Earnshaw feels so superior. He treats Heathcliff like a slumdog and has never been once polite to him. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Catherine and Heathcliff are both young, around the same age, and they grow up together. I often pictured them like dogs in my mind, especially in their childhood. They fight a lot literally in the mud most of the time , but they are very loyal to each other, like if no one can bother the other but him herself.While growing up, they are randomly and alternatively hopelessly in love and full of hatred toward the other. It was really hard to follow sometimes. I think that they mostly love each other, but they know they are not supposed to, and they also don t know how to express it properly. That is how they end up being so mean. Despite the fact that they both act like animals and they are equally mean, they don t end up with the same future. Catherine marries the well educated, smart Edgar Linton while Heathcliff runs away. I think that Edgar Linton was the nicest character of them all, I really gotten fond of him, he was so full of love and respect for Catherine both of them actually . He was selfless and took the best care possible of his girls. He was patient and tired to understand Catherine without judgments. Emily Bront really knows how to write, that is for sure, she know how to be true and faithful to her characters defaults, but making us liking them nonetheless.I don t think I need to develop a lot on this book, whoever haven t read it yet, you just definitely should.

I have to say, though, that I find Heathcliff to be one of the most compelling characters out there. I didn t find him immediately evil and, in fact, I rather felt for the guy up until he gets physical with his soon to be daughter in law. Those intense feelings of jealousy and consternation over the ambiguities of his friend love, as well as the injured sense of justice that he holds honestly, I ve felt all those things rather deeply, at times more particularly in my teenage years . I felt a great deal of sympathy for the man.Then things suddenly went wrong. His manipulations of conversations, others weaknesses, and legalities I can understand, though I myself would never use such tactics. But when he gets downright physically abusive, he crossed the line from emo with a cause to bullying jerk. Suddenly, I found myself despising the man.In the end, though, I again found myself sympathetic to his madness. The obsession and drive that kept him alive, yearning, and reaching for his Catherine were qualities to be admired, to some degree, though with eyes averted enough that onlookers won t think that they are being admired. I found it fitting that this same drive pushed him closer and closer to the death he secretly welcomed. The closer he came to seeing Catherine again, the closer he came to death, and the happier he was. Heathcliff was everything an emo aspires to, always reaching for the unattainable and only satisfied when dying in the process.Yes, there are a plethora of other characters, each with their own complexity I am a particular fan of Catherine Earnshaw, a marvelously complex person , but the real action, the real driver behind it all is Heathcliff. Love him or hate him or vacillate back and forth like I did , he is the engine behind the plot and forms the other characters sometimes by carving through them .As far as the writing goes, it s Victorian writing overwrought, purple, baroque, at times tedious, at times brilliant. My only complaint was the insistence on phonetically spelling out some of the thicker Yorkshire accents. This became a little over the top and I found myself skimming whenever Joseph spoke. And there s that self righteous Nelly. Argh. If I had Nelly nagging me and preachifying all the time I might just find myself digging up the body of my dead former girlfriend and . . . well, that explains a whole lot, doesn t it "
"80","Wuthering Heights"," 27, 2016 Mimi","really liked it"," Liked it much better this time around mostly because I chose to read it for a book club , not because it was forced on me as a school assignment.Back then, I didn t or maybe couldn t appreciate the sweeping nature of Emily Bronte s use of language, but now I like it. She painted countryside scenery so very well, and she did the same with extreme characterization. I could read whole books about the wilderness and the moors and cliffs and crags of Wuthering Heights. The land on which the estate sat was painted with sweeping language as well, but with a haunting overtone. The scenery overall is beautifully rendered, and the characters and their relationships too, though tragically so. I think it was this book that made me first realize I had an intense appreciation for stories that don t end well, and the intensity of Bronte s language makes experiencing her creation a deeply visceral albeit somewhat satisfying, somewhat disturbing journey. I cannot express it but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you. What were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained here My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff s miseries, and I watched and felt each from the beginning my great thought in living is himself. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger I should not seem a part of it. My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods time will change it, I m well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff He s always, always in my mind not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being. "

"82","Wuthering Heights"," 02, 2015 Stela","it was amazing"," The Hero of All Anti Heroes Human soul is not necessarily beautiful even when it is hurting, love does not have to be unrequited or forbidden to be cursed, reason wide awake does not always keep monsters at bay, a strong will does not always mean a noble heart and weakness is not always to be pitied.Or so Emily Bronte seems to tell us, in this strange story that keeps scattering old myths of star crossed lovers that haunted the imagination of the mankind from Tristan and Isolde to Romeo and Juliet and beyond. What if, the author challenges us, love does not excuse everything Moreover, what if it does not make us better, nobler, worthier, but rather reveals the darkness of our souls What if the reasons of the heart are not reasons at all, but blind nature forces, wuthering winds that rise the soul to impossible heights only to let it fall more deeply into the abyss And what if the soul not only accepts that but welcomes it If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable. I dreamt once that I was there. heaven did not seem to be my home and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights Thus spake Catherine, this intriguing characters of Wuthering Heights, however not as intriguing as Heathcliff, a hero anti hero with powerful and destructive passions. Whereas Catherine is, after all, not quite difficult to understand, a typical case of, to put it bluntly, wanting to have the cake and eat it too, Heathcliff s actions and motivations are not so easy to untangle.One cannot help but admire him, for he has the same grim dignity the brute force of nature unleashed has got, in both his love and his hate. Furthermore, he has little patience for the fool and for the weak It s odd what a savage feeling I have to anything that seems afraid of me and he punishes accordingly those who try and reduce him to a clich and an infatuation She abandoned them under a delusion, picturing in me a hero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion. I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature, so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character and acting on the false impressions she cherished. It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to discover that I did not love her. I believed, at one time, no lessons could teach her that I ve always suspected that Emily Bront created Heathcliff as a malicious representation of the Romantic ideal hero, as a parody of the triumph of the sentiment over the reason, of the nature versus nurture and so on. For his exceptional qualities are not crushed by a haughty society rather stimulated by it but by himself. He betters himself firstly to be worthy of Catherine s love, and after that to take revenge on those who stole her from him. He has no mercy, he despises everybody but Ellen Dean and Hareton, he is cruel and violent without apparent reason. True to his name, he is desert, he is acid and he is alone.He could be, and this is the most interesting feature of the character, he should be a villain. But he is not. It is hard to explain why he is loved. By Catherine s father and Hareton and Nelly. And above all, by countless readers. Redeemed by his love Too easy an explanation, although he expresses his feelings unforgettably In every cloud, in every tree filling the air at night, and caught by glimpses in every object by day I am surrounded with her image The most ordinary faces of men and women my own features mock me with a resemblance. The entire world is a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist, and that I have lost her Unpredictable like the weather, inflexible in his likes and dislikes like an unforgivable god, always proud to reveal himself as he is, warts and all, Heathcliff is one of the most fascinating characters literature has given us, through a little English lady who, with this one and only novel she wrote, was to become one of the greatest writers of all times.

I m outraged that Heathcliff is considered a romantic hero. I never thought I could hate a character as much as I hate Heathcliff. Go jump off the moor, Heathcliff. No one likes you. I m super sensitive on how unhealthy relationships are portrayed as romantic and this book makes me legit angry. Heathcliff and Cathy s relationship is so dysfunctional, so unhealthy. It s not right people. IT S NOT RIGHT.I also got annoyed at Joseph s dialect. Unnecessary in my opinion. I ended up skimming his dialogue and using context clues as to what he said. Nobody got time for that.The only thing that was redeeming to it was the atmospheric mood of the novel. It has a very ominous and dark mood to it which fits the story perfectly. I worry about Emily even though she s long dead . The story had nice pacing even though the story within the story was awkward. The only character I liked in here was Mr. Lockwood but only marginally. Even he was creepy.Let s just chalk it up to Wuthering Heights and me weren t a match.

There is no doubt that Emily Bront s masterpiece and her only novel Wuthering Heights is a modern myth. And superior to Charlotte Bront s nonetheless, excellent period piece Jane Eyre. The ingenious mind of the latter s younger sister recognized, consciously or subconsciously, the archetypal structures of myth and the timeless forms of its characters and made them act on behalf of her own ferocious imagination. But those expecting to take a nice stroll down a comfortable literary landscape a There is no doubt that Emily Bront s masterpiece and her only novel Wuthering Heights is a modern myth. And superior to Charlotte Bront s nonetheless, excellent period piece Jane Eyre. The ingenious mind of the latter s younger sister recognized, consciously or subconsciously, the archetypal structures of myth and the timeless forms of its characters and made them act on behalf of her own ferocious imagination. But those expecting to take a nice stroll down a comfortable literary landscape amidst a bunch of likeable, easily understandable characters, do not need to bother with this one. Because nothing about Wuthering Heights is easy. It is a complex and uncompromising, almost morbid study of the dark side of human nature.The dissection is done through several characters ambiguity and immorality isn t attributed to the protagonist only, even if he towers above everyone else. Despite that, the book itself does not lack a moral center, which is personified by the narrative voice of the housekeeper Nelly Dean and to an extent by her co narrator Mr. Lockwood. They are the two people who, no matter how affected by what they see or have to live with, never once lose their way.The first volume of the novel follows the growth and transformation of Catherine Earnshaw and the second volume that of her daughter, but on the whole it is an observation of the character of Heathcliff. He remains an enigma, from the day he is brought to live with the Earnshaws a little gipsy kid to the day he dies, in circumstances also unexplained, leaving us to speculate whether he might have been coaxed into it by the phantom of Catherine herself. Heathcliff embodies the so called literary Byronic hero basically a variation of an anti hero defined as a brooding and tormented semi romantic male and often described as clad in black and having dark eyes or hair. Generally, he expresses a hateful attitude towards the world and himself and is dominated by obsessive love for one woman. In classic fiction we need look no further than the figures of Dracula or Rochester the more modern version of this archetype can be found in J.K. Rowling s Severus Snape a creation of another British female author. Heathcliff s major personality flaw is common pride, and his thirst for revenge Shakespearean. Though oddly stoic when you think about it, psychologically he doesn t really change much during the course of the book , his presence is so powerful that it grips us like a vice and doesn t let go. A wide range of emotions is aroused hope, sadness, pity, fear, terror, frustration, anger even secret admiration and attraction, for he is a handsome, strong willed and intelligent man. Unfortunately he is too far gone to be saved.Catherine is a passionate and selfish woman suffering from severe bipolar tendencies. Her anxieties partly self imposed, partly caused by her mental disorder reflect the poetic duality of her nature. There s the wildness that corresponds to her fundamental love for Heathcliff and on the other hand a greedy desire for a life of a higher standard than what she is provided with at the residence of Wuthering Heights. The collision of these two forces inside of her renders her existence unbearable for her. Whilst maybe less memorable than, for example, Margaret Mitchell s Scarlett O Hara, Cathy is a tragic heroine of her own right. A sort of a beastess, always craving and hardly ever satisfied. Looking at the bigger picture, the flesh and blood being seems to dissolve into something abstract and ethereal like a fragment of Heathcliff s soul, violently ripped from him. The creepy inhuman quality that she has makes us ask the question was she alive at all Or did she just convince them, and us, that she was real For me, the third most fascinating and perplexing character might be Heathcliff s and Isabella s son Linton. An androgynous, relentlessly moody and lethargic boy, whom cruel fate robbed of any chance for a normal life the moment his biological father decided to claim him. Would he have survived and developed into a better person, had he been able to stay at Thrushcross Grange He serves as a romantic red herring as well, because at some point we start to believe that him and Catherine junior are meant to be.The tale told is so heavy on dramatic irony that it feels as though we encounter it at each new turn of the events. When drunken Hindley Earnshaw drops baby Hareton from the top of the stairs, it is his sworn enemy, Heathcliff, who catches the child. Hareton is then someone Heathcliff perhaps, against his wishes, becomes fond of. Disregarding her father s efforts to secure her future at Thrushcross Grange, young Catherine Linton is drawn to her mother s old home and its inhabitants and later ends up imprisoned in there. Catherine and Hareton together stand for what her mother and Heathcliff failed to obtain. And the ultimate twist the dirty underdog and stable boy eventually raising as the triumphant master of Wuthering Heights.The imagery is delicious and strewn with stylistically pure elements of the horror genre, and, on occasion, motifs from Nordic folklore. We have the grim interior of the house of Wuthering Heights people getting lost in snowstorms or drenched in rain moonlight walks, churchyards and gravestones ghostly pale faces and locks of hair kept in lockets. Heathcliff bless him can t rest before he digs out his lover s coffin, and he gets so annoyed at his legal wife, he flings a kitchen knife at her. He is compared to a wolf, a vampire, a goblin, and numerous times to the devil. The idyllic Yorkshire moors play such an important role that they resemble a living, breathing entity. To the characters the heather moors symbolize freedom, a peaceful paradise, but are simultaneously a desolate place that spurs superstitious ideas about the world of the dead.With its dynamic and tightly wound tapestry of murky, unsettling themes, Wuthering Heights represents the pinnacle of tragic storytelling. A gothic dream that lingers to haunt you for a long long time. Freud and Jung would surely have heaps of fun reading it. "
"89","Wuthering Heights"," 28, 2010 Stephen","really liked it"," 4.0 stars. This is one of those love it or hate it books that I think depends, at least somewhat, on the reader s expectations when they open the book up. Objectively, I think it is safe to say that the book is very well written and not very long so you don t have the problem of the rambling narrative saying in 20 pages what could be better said it 2 paragraphs . The disparity of opinion I think largely comes from that fact that the narrative of the story is brutal, depressing and does not contain A SINGLE GENUINELY GOOD CHARACTER. No argument there, this is not a bright sunny day at the beach. However, as a GOTHIC NOVEL, I think it is superb and HEATHCLIFF has immediately become one of my top 10 most memorable characters in all of classic ficiton. He is unrelentingly and unapologetically brutish, devious and mean. Taking a tour of other great villains since the 60 s Heathcliff was Max Cady Cape Fear 60 s , Nurse Ratched One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest 70 s , J.R. Ewing Dallas 80 s...sorry couldn t think of a better one , Kevin Spacey forget his character s name Swimming with Sharks 90 s...and one of the truly unredeemable characters ever , and Col. Hans Landa Inglourious Basterds 2000 s . All of those characters made us cringe but we loved when they were on screen and I felt the same way about Heathcliff. Oh, and it is not just Heathcliff, though he is the worst. Catherine his life long love interest is equally despicable in her own way and all the other characters, usually as a result of their treatment at the hands of Heathcliff or Catherine, are varying levels of nasty. Reading this was like watching a steel cage deathmatch being fought with words, schemes and insults. All of the above made this a fascinating read and I really did enjoy it. While I didn t give this a 5 stars rating because I do, on the whole prefer happier endings , I think this is a unique and superb example of Gothic fiction. Highly Recommeded "

"93","Wuthering Heights"," 24, 2016 Abubakar Mehdi","it was amazing"," This book is a tsunami of passions. Passions that are as wild as the moors that surround Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. The characters have an emotional depth, a quite stunning liveliness, that breathes life into the dialogue. Written in coarse and creamy Victorian style, this is a story of deceit, corruption, jealousy, vendetta, and Love. A love so fiercely passionate, so annihilating that it consumed all happiness from the lives of the people who had the misfortune of dwelling in its proximity. To say that unrequited love, is the purest and truest form of romantic love will not be too wrong. Love, as we know it, when reciprocated becomes a mutual affair, a sentiment to be shared between two people, an emotional variable whose value can never remain constant for long. It becomes a public matter, other people get involved and it gets rather complicated. A million other things start affecting it. But such is not the case with one sided, Unrequited love. Because its yours to rear and nurture. You have exclusive rights over it, you can keep it hidden from the whole world, a secret that will remain private for as long as you want, and will be your companion through out your life. It is not a pleasant thing. And it is, I believe, a thing that only few can do. But Its only possible when the association with your beloved is more than mere infatuation or sexual attraction, but a bond that transcends categorisation. A bond that becomes an integral part of your identity and to break it, is to shatter your own self into a million pieces. Heathcliff didn t just love Catherine, he belonged to her. And she to him. They were more than childhood playmates, they were companions. And any journey without your companion is an ordeal, a torture worse than any other. Where every street, every corner and sign board impresses upon you the fact that you are alone. Habit becomes necessity, and life as you know it, begins and ends with her . To live without her isn t just impossible, but implausible.Heathcliff s love for Catherine comes from a mutual feeling that its them against the world. That they are aliens from a different land who ll only find solace in each other. Robbed of that, there is little left, but to torment and destroy everything that comes in their way. Everything that even remotely reminds them why they are not together. Heathcliff spent almost all of his life in mourning and remorse. While you pity the poor Hindley, Hareton, Catherine, Edgar, Isabella, and Nelly, spare some pitying for Heathcliff too. He is the man who lived without the woman he loved. Nothing is more painful then that.... "
"94","Wuthering Heights"," 25, 2016 Hassan","it was amazing"," It was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles, but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn. After 2 days of contemplation about what I just read, cause this novel is not your normal type of novel, it was certainly unique, the characters are so unlovable, I ve never abhorred characters this much in my life, and the whole atmosphere of the novel is so dismal and queer. It needs some getting used to in the beginning, also it s set in a very isolated and obsolete place, which in a way reflect these selfish and despicable characters, it shows how isolated and introverts they are, all these elements plus a very whimsical writing style contributed to create one of the most unique and stylistic classic probably ever.I don t mind hating a character in a book, In fact if a bad character made me hate him so much and forget for a second that he s fictional, then I tend to enjoy this character, almost every single character in this book is very well written yet unlovable to the point that will make you appreciate how unlovable they re. It also shows that there s no one born evil, but people s hardships and the difficulties they get through are the reason for them to be that way. The book focuses on the point that forgiveness is what differentiate between the good and the evil, yet because it s very realistic most of the characters if not all of them choose to follow the path of vengeance and never forgive, till they realize that they re becoming like the characters whom they want to avenge. The character element is one of the strongest things about this book, and it portrays the cycle of vengeance in such brilliant way. and Thrushcross grange are the perfect setting for this story, the houses represent all of emotions, and all the egotism of the characters, it also shows how these people are living in their own world, which will turn out to be their prison, their battlefield.Some people seek hoping to read about an epic romantic tale, and I really recommend if you re going to read it expecting that, not to read it at all, cause is not a love story at all, it s a tale of vengeance between two families that will lead to the ruin of both families, however it offer us a hope, hope that can never be achieved unless we learn to forgive.

"96","Wuthering Heights"," 07, 2007 Silvana","really liked it"," I feel good after reading this book. It s as good as the movie yay usually the movie version is worse , I m talking about the one with Ralph Fiennes and Juliet Binoche.Anyway, now I know why I dislike Jane Austen s novels. Wuthering Heights offers a more interesting theme, it does not focus in Victorian culture and ways of society cough which is boring cough and it has more intriguing characters.The romance is just awesome. Who could forget Heathcliff s dedication and undying love for Catherine I think after Scarlett O Hara and Rhett Butler, Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw is my most favorite romantic couple.Heathcliff is an orphan, a vagabond, taken to live with the Earnshaws in Wuthering Heights. He grew up with Catherine, who was the only person in the world that could understand him. Vice versa. Both developed a unique, unbreakable relationship, ranging from best friends, brother and sister, and finally ... love.Unfortunately, things did not work out well with them. Catherine married someone else, she had a daughter, named after her. However, Cathy Linton was different from her mother, although her charm and heritage made Heathcliff forced her to be his daughter in law.Heathcliff never forget Catherine. Not ever. I shall not spoil it here, but there is one certain scene when Heathcliff pronounced his love to Catherine, which made me shudder and gave me goosebumps. Every woman in the world probably would kill to have a love just like what Heathcliff had for Catherine. That fiery, passionate, insatiable love...hmmm... "
"97","Wuthering Heights"," 15, 2015 P","it was amazing"," 2015 I have just returned from a visit to my old neighbourhood, a crumbling council owned territory in northern England, where I had been tasked with putting in order my grandfather s estate. Of course, by estate I mean the few rags and personal, but perfectly worthless, objects that my grandfather had accumulated during his long, and scarcely happy, existence. I must return on the morrow, to complete this task.The day had set in gloomy and cold, and my fingers were stricken, even before venturing outside, with a dull ache the like of which always besets me in winter. So I had no mind to make for that stoney edifice where I had just yesterday spent many none too pleasant hours. Yet the task of sorting through my grandfather s meagre things would be upon my shoulders some future day, like it or not, so postponement would little benefit me.I took, of course, a bus, the windows of which were so mired in dirt that I could, for all I knew, have been heading for anywhere. It was only the familiar rattle of stones and rocks rebounding off the side of the bus, which from experience I put down to the arms of local children, that spoke of being near to my intended destination. Much in fear of the bus being turned over, I silently willed my journey to its end. However, upon alighting I felt sorry for having done so, for the cold and gloom were much intensified here, being at the top of a hill.Inside the dour tenement block, I vainly pushed the button for the elevator, before accepting defeat, as I had done yesterday also. The stairs, which I was forced to confront, were clearly the whim of a madman. Each step was thicker or thinner than the last, so that one climbed them in the fashion of a spider with an injured leg negotiating a half ruined web. At the top I was met, much to my surprise and chagrin, by Mr Bower, my late grandfather s immediate neighbour. Yah fer tah coom ta spayke baht guings uhn, ave ye Ye ll wahn ta nuh I d weger, baht yon granfither an whet tuck place thear, he said, all of which was quite incomprehensible to me, despite being born and raised in these parts. Before I could enter the key into the lock of my grandfather s flat, and take my leave of the old man s hideous visage, he wildly shook his walking stick at me in what I took to be an invitation to enter his abode. Verily, I had no choice but to follow, for I feared for my life lest I refuse.Inside the old man s dwelling, I was guided to the living room, and then of a sudden left to my own devices. Not wishing to take a seat uninvited I took note instead of the shelves against the walls, in particular those upon which a few books were stacked. Indeed, I had just taken down a copy of Wuthering Heights, a book I greatly favour, when a young lady entered. Understandably I ventured to suppose she might be Mr Bower s granddaughter, and so I greeted her accordingly. There s no Miss Bower here, she replied. Sit down, sir. I sat, rather without pleasure, on the sofa. She took her place opposite. You ll have to forgive the old man, he doesn t see too many faces, and those he does see he appropriates for himself. The young lady, it turned out, was another neighbour, whom Mr Bower had also appropriated. He s gone back out onto the landing. T will be sometime yet before he returns and frees us. Are you from around here, sir I told her that I had been born but not a few doors away. Ah, a Yorkshireman You don t sound it. I granted her that, but said that no matter how my speech might strike I felt, in my bones, always a Yorkshireman. It s a strange part of the world, isn t it, sir Gets under your skin. This I granted also. What have you in your hand At this remark I realised that I had still the book in my possession. A book. Wuthering Heights. T is the old man s. I was looking at his shelves. A fine Yorkshire book She laughed. Have you read it, sir More than once, I confessed. You have perhaps read it also Indeed I have. I esteem is just as much as you evidently do yourself, sir. Ah, you like Heathcliff, I imagine. Heathcliff she scoffed. What madness would compel me to like Heathcliff He s a brute. A sadist. He hangs dogs he marries a woman so as to hurt her father he torments his own son. Heathcliff I concur, Miss, but for many he is a kind of romantic hero. Nay. Maybe the idea of him is. Maybe what he represents. Which is A man so in love, or so obsessed with his love, that it drives him mad. Ah, that is a romantic idea, but no woman could like Heathcliff for himself. I ve often thought that he wasn t really a man, but half a man. I ventured, warming to my task. In a way, he isn t even a character for me he simply represents one side of human nature, the wild and passionate side. Edgar Linton, whom Cathy marries, is rationality, is propriety and good breeding. Together they would make a perfect man. It is why Cathy is so torn, because they speak to different aspects of her own personality. Yes, one might say that Heathcliff is the devil on the shoulder, and Linton the angel, the bright young lady replied. Or, if you rather, one is the Appollonian and t other is the Dionysian. The second Cathy, the daughter of the original, tames, or harnesses her Dionysus Hareton , in a way her own mother could not, by helping him to read and write and cultivating his softer side, by refining him a little. I think that is Bronte s ultimate message that you need both sides, but in moderation, in order to find true happiness. The book is more than just about that, however. Upbringing and parenting, it strikes me, are important themes. None of the children in the book are raised correctly. Some are raised without love and care, and others are too indulged, so that they become either spoilt or roguish. Marriage was obviously under her microscope too. Who marries happily No one. They all make bad choices, cept the younger Cathy and even she marries badly, and for the wrong reasons, the first time around I say again, strange that some would have that it s a love story Do stop prattling on about love, sir, we have already dealt with that. Besides, it is a love story, just not a conventional one. One might say that the book asks, what is love And, how ought one behave if one is in love Heathcliff claims to love Cathy and yet treats her horribly. She claims to love Heathcliff and her husband, yet does right by neither. Her daughter loves and marries Linton out of pity. T is a complicated business, love. One cannot always identify it with complete assurance, for it often skulks around in the shadows with its playmates, duty and infatuation. I must confess that I felt the sharpness of that prattling, but I did not let it deter me. Therefore I continued, Now that you mention it, Heathcliff s love for Cathy is the basis for one of my few criticisms of the book. That he is rendered mad by it is undeniable, yet the actual cause of his love escapes me. What I mean by this, if I may explain myself further, is that we are to take Bronte s word for it that Cathy and Heathcliff have such an incredible bond, that they love each other, but one never witnesses anything between them there are no passages of great tenderness, or bonding, or sharing to justify it. We are told they were close as children, but we aren t privy to that closeness beyond one or two seemingly insignificant episodes. Oh, I rather like that. I like that we don t see, but have to imagine, instead. If I have a criticism of my own to make t would be the structure of the thing. That is, to be polite, somewhat awkward. Ah, we are at variance again, Miss. I don t share your concern. Yes, yes it isn t elegant, not at all, what with it starting out as Lockwood s first person narration, which then shifts to Nelly Dean s, and then shifts twice or thrice more times. I grant that Lockwood telling us what Nelly tells him, which also includes letters from other characters and speeches from other employees, is a creative writing professor s nightmare, but does any of that trouble one s enjoyment That is the important question. Are you saying that when Lockwood, about half of the way into the book, takes over Nelly s story and, well, stands in for her, using the personal I, even though Nelly herself is no longer present, is not a problem for you, sir Oh, certainly it is, if I have my academic hat on. But I repeat did it trouble your enjoyment Not especially. She said, folding her hands in her lap, Well, not at all, no. Well, and so why belabour the point I replied, waving the book around. The structure is messy, of course, no one would deny it, but no book is perfect, all books are flawed. I m a literary critic, and it is such a miserable thing, Miss. So, away, let us forget all about structure or any other negativity, even my own small criticisms. Wuthering Heights is a page turner, one fairly romps through it, like one could romp through the the Moors themselves. It is bombastic and thrilling and gothic and gripping and funny yes, funny too the opening of the novel Lockwood s first visits to the house are hilarious, it s as though he has stumbled upon the Klopeks from The Burbs. Have you seen The Burbs, Miss A fine film, featuring Tom Hanks Before my lady could answer Mr Bower entered the room. Shey nut seyan ahnuthing lake thar, he grumbled. Mr Bower, I said, rising to my feet. I must beg your leave. I have much to accomplish next door. The man s ghoulish countenance darkened, and once again he waved his stick in my direction. Thear thee go Nay, nowt uh reckon firt tug go. I think he rather likes you, opined the lady. Likes Why he is the very Devil Am I never to leave this accursed room Oh, he will get bored of us soon. Stay and take some tea, sir. We can continue our interesting discussion. I have nothing more to say, Miss I was fairly rattled, I must admit. So you have exhausted your opinions on Wuthering Heights. Villette, then Yes, Villette. A great book. Fine. But, that s it there I draw the line. Don t even think about mentioning The Tenant of Wildfell Hall "

It s enshrined in the literary canon, popular across every generation of English language readers since 1847, and regularly makes best books lists but it also arouses fierce detestation from a significant minority of readers. In my friend circle, ratings for it range from five stars down to one, though with many more of the former. My own rating is in the middle with a solid three stars, meaning that I liked it but not superlatively so it s a foregone conclusion that readers at both extremes of the spectrum can expect to find aspects of this review that they disagree with. It s been said that fools rush in where angels fear to tread.... Many readers are already familiar with the plots of 19th century novels that are frequently taught in high school and college courses, and bandied about in literary conversations. But if you re unfamiliar with the plot of this one, I d advise against reading the Goodreads description, which divulges enough of the plot though not the ending to be considered spoilerish. I ll try to avoid the same faux pas myself Also, I would alert you to the fact that, if you think as I did that you know the plot of the book from watching the 1970 movie adaptation starring Timothy Dalton and Anna Calder Marshall you don t it doesn t follow the book. It omits about the last half of it, drastically changes the ending, and introduces an element of adulterous sex that s not in the original. This is historical fiction done in the Romantic style, with both a stress on the unbridled expression of the characters emotions here mostly small r romantic passion infatuation, obsession, rage, hate, and a craze for vengeance and a frank appeal to the readers emotions, the main ones evoked in this case being horror, sorrow, anger and pity. The location is Bronte s native rural Yorkshire, a terrain she knew well, and the chronological setting is in the couple of generations just before her own, the late 1700s and early 1800s one of my favorite time periods for historical fiction , a milieu she d have known from the oral recollections of family members and neighbors. Bronte employs a complex, non linear narrative structure for the tale, with most of it viewed through the eyes of an outsider, Lockwood, or related at second hand by Nellie Dean, a character who was a close observer of events, but not a principal. Since this was Bronte s first and only novel, readers who dislike and resent this kind of structure sometimes attribute it in this case to the author s amateurish incompetence the poor stupid girl, in this view, just didn t understand that this isn t how novels are properly written. Personally, I beg to differ IMO, there s much more intentionality and purpose to this structure than some people give Emily credit for. The opening piques our interest with the question of how this state of affairs came about, and the fact that the major characters are viewed primarily through other eyes than their own allows for a more objective appraisal of their actions and motives than we d be apt to get from their perspectives.In listing the characters principal emotions above, I didn t mention love. That may seem strange, given that this novel is almost always represented as a great love story though, to my knowledge, there s no particular evidence that Bronte herself advertised it as such. There is real love in the book, I think, but it doesn t dominate the lion s share of the 34 chapter narrative. It s a story about passionate obsession, about infatuation with an imagined image of a person, about selfishness, about betrayal, and about all consuming desire for vengeance that ruins lives, including the life of the person carrying the vendetta. I disagree with literary critic Katherine Frank, who does the Introduction to the edition I read, and who asserts that the book lacks a moral centre I d say it could be read very much as a morality tale, depicting the sad consequences of lousy attitudes and behavior. But it is NOT, primarily, a story of real love between two people who genuinely care more about their beloved s happiness than they do their own, or who share a commitment to each other that no temptation can break.If then, this isn t a novel about love, what is it about, at its core Much ink has apparently been spilled by critics posing answers to this question, and I don t imagine that mine is a definitive last word on the subject. But I think that, at least in part, it s thematically akin to Sense and Sensibility Austen and Bronte were very different women, but both seem to me to be dealing with the great philosophical debate between the spirits of Neoclassicism and Romanticism, between the view of the world that stresses order, rationality, civilization, refinement, respectability everything that the Lintons and Thrushcross Grange stand for in the book versus the view that glorifies wildness, freedom, feeling, unfettered and unschooled Nature, embodied in the environment of Wuthering Heights and everything it stands for. The symbolic contrast between the two here is drawn with great artistry, and can hardly be dismissed as accidental. Where Austen comes down solidly on the side of sense, Bronte s message is more inclusive especially through her ending which, unlike at least one reviewer, I quite like though I won t say what it is , she suggests that both perspectives have value and we need to blend them.Above, I ve indicated a couple of areas where the literary craftsmanship here is very fine. Bronte also conjures a very powerful sense of place, an evocation of the feeling of what the moors must be like, even though I ve never been there the natural world can be almost a character itself here. The author also presents a subversive view of a highly class conscious and sexist society, which is implicitly criticized even though the geographical scope here is limited to one very small rural community as most people s horizons would have been in 1801, and even in 1847 . And she draws her characters very well they re realistic people who come alive to us. Most of them, though, are unlikable people, some extremely so. I liked Lockwood and Nellie, I liked young Catherine and cared about her, and I came to like and appreciate Hareton, which is why the novel succeeded for me as well as it did. But I wasn t friends with any of the other characters and for me the heavy dosage of human misery, tragedy, suffering and sorrow, some of it really undeserved, that occupies most of the book was hard to take. I m not the kind of reader who revels in going through three boxes of tissues to wipe my tears when I read a book for me, that reduced my reading pleasure. I agree with reviewers who reckon Jane Eyre to be the more enjoyable of the two novels. But for all that, I felt the book ultimately earned its three stars, and I m glad to have read it. "
"99","Wuthering Heights"," 05, 2016 Viv JM","it was ok"," Wuthering Heights is considered a classic and is loved by many people including a good number of friends here on Goodreads so I feel kind of guilty for not liking it more.The spookily gothic beginning was promising , and I liked the ending too. The middle, not so much I am alarmed that the book is considered to be a romance by many. The romantic hero is a bully and a violent sociopath the heroine is sneering and manipulative, and their so called love is more like a pathological and destructive obsession. How is this a great love story A study of grief, madness and the darkness of the human psyche maybe, but not romance.I m not averse to unlikeable characters in books, but I just found the overall tone so melodramatic and overwrought that I could not enjoy it, although I did appreciate the evocative portrayal of the moors.I listened to the audiobook version, narrated by Patricia Routledge. For the most part, she did a great job but there was some unintentional comedic value for me in her portrayal of the servant Joseph, in that she made him sound just like Johnny Vegas. "

"103","Wuthering Heights"," 08, 2015 Sally Howes","liked it"," My experience of WUTHERING HEIGHTS was simple the unrelenting hate of the characters inspired hate for them in me their contempt for each other inspired contempt for them in me their cold callousness inspired in me an almost total lack of interest in their fates. Normally I respect and enjoy wicked characters as much as virtuous ones, but these, especially Heathcliff and Hindley, are so unrelentingly and irredeemably wicked, with an almost if not total lack of virtue, that I could not get past my own violent dislike of them. It is said of Hindley that He had room in his heart for only two idols his wife and himself he doted on both, and adored one ... And this is one of the milder descriptions of his self centeredness. My antipathy for this book comes from the fact that of all the components of a story language, plot, themes, characters, and so on characters are usually the most important to me, and I found every character in WUTHERING HEIGHTS, without exception, to be either repugnant or ridiculous. Some of my favorite characters in literature are characters that I love to hate, but they are usually balanced by surrounding characters who are more sympathetic. WUTHERING HEIGHTS may be the first book I have ever read in which I could not bring myself to care about a single character, not even a minor one. And of course, the book is famed as the story of Cathy and Heathcliff s tempestuous, heart rending love for each other. However, I did not see them as lovers at all, because their need for each other was so much greater than their love for each other. If it is love at all, it is an extremely selfish love, which seems to me to be a contradiction in terms. This is not a romance, this is a story of destructive obsession. In my eyes, the book s greatest redeeming features are its inspired use of language and very effective atmospheric details, but for a reader like me, these were never going to be enough to overcome its ghastly characters.True to its era, there are many differences in style between WUTHERING HEIGHTS and modern novels, sometimes enchanting and sometimes disconcerting. Not the least of these is the story s tendency to meander and digress. Sometimes these sidetracks lead to hidden gems and sometimes they lead nowhere at all. WUTHERING HEIGHTS is comprised of stories within stories within stories. This layering has several interesting effects, such as sometimes giving a feeling of distance from the narrative, allowing room for retrospective contemplation, and building suspense.Ellen Dean, who narrates the greater part of the story, seems a particularly unreliable narrator, almost as passionate in her own way as Cathy, although Nelly s is more akin to a passionate scorn for her employers. As a servant, Ellen appears to be sullen, impertinent, and even spiteful, which makes her neither a sympathetic nor a very trustworthy narrator. She is not the only one, though. The book has several narrators, all of whom have quite strong prejudices, which is important to keep in mind while sifting through the second and third hand accounts of Cathy and Heathcliff s lives. It is easy to forget that the bias of its narrators is an extra, subtle component of the story s mystery.Mr. Lockwood s first exploration of Wuthering Heights itself reveals more about the book than it does about this house full of secrets it certainly establishes its Gothic nature and is strongly reminiscent of that other Bronte sister classic, JANE EYRE. Indeed, its Gothic feel and the constant presence of the bleakly beautiful moor was the thing I enjoyed most about WUTHERING HEIGHTS. This sentence is a typically evocative description A sorrowful sight I saw dark night coming down prematurely, and sky and hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow. The moor is more even than a character in this story, it is an all pervading presence, infecting people especially Heathcliff and Cathy with its implacable wildness and even, at times, reckless savagery. There is a very real and essential connection between the wild moor and the wildness of the souls of Cathy and Heathcliff. It is some kind of primal connection that seems all but essential to their lives and their sanity and their selfhood.This book is full of violence, not just latent or implied but casually and frequently evident. As we are introduced to Wuthering Heights during Cathy and Heathcliff s youth, we feel that we have entered a madhouse, full of the most vicious hate as well as the most violent love. It can be truly overwhelming at times. I found this passage particularly evocative Heathcliff s abode at the Heights was an oppression past explaining. I felt that God had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked wanderings, and an evil beast prowled between it and the fold, waiting his time to spring and destroy. Everything about entering the pages of WUTHERING HEIGHTS is dark and forbidding, with an undercurrent of malevolence. This applies even more to the people who are almost uncanny in the Freudian sense than to the setting. As Nelly says We don t in general take to foreigners here ... unless they take to us first. Cathy is quite the wildcat, and her excessive passion and pig headedness can be wearing to say the least, even when inspired by apparently good intentions. She says of Heathcliff that ... he shall never know how I love him and that ... he s more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same ... And to me, this passage shows her obsessiveness to a chilling degree My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff s miseries, and I watched and felt each from the beginning my great thought in living is himself. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger I should not seem a part of it. Cathy is the very picture of a woman who desires to have her cake and eat it, too. Despite her protestations of love for Heathcliff, she attaches herself to the wealthy and genteel Edgar Linton, limply asserting that she is doing so partly to help Heathcliff rise in the world. It is abundantly clear that she wants Heathcliff all to herself as well. This makes her appear selfish, mean spirited, and grasping, along with her other repugnant qualities. She quietly or not so quietly enjoys being the center of a love triangle. Nelly has many instructive things to say about Cathy s pride and selfishness ... she was full of ambition, and it led her to develop a double character without exactly intending to deceive any one ... she was so proud, it became really impossible to pity her distresses ... ... she felt small trouble regarding any subject, save her own concerns ... it was nothing less than murder in her eyes for any one to presume to stand up and contradict her ... she seemed to allow herself such wide latitude, that I had little faith in her principles, and still less sympathy for her feelings. Of Heathcliff we only hear at second or third hand from the aforementioned unreliable narrators, so that he appears doubly dark and mysterious. Heathcliff epitomizes the sentiment that vengeance is a dish best served cold, but he also demonstrates how thoroughly it eats away the heart and blackens the soul. Whether he is justified in hating anyone is almost beside the point for me. His premeditated, willful torture of virtually everyone who is unfortunate enough to fall under his power can have no adequate justification. Even Cathy says Pray, don t imagine that he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior He s not a rough diamond a pearl containing oyster of a rustic he s a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man. And as Edgar Linton learns through bitter experience Mr. Heathcliff ... is a most diabolical man, delighting to wrong and ruin those he hates, if they give him the slightest opportunity. WUTHERING HEIGHTS will always be for me the classic that I so badly wanted to like but simply could not. Perhaps I can say that the moor itself was the only character that really gripped me, whereas every human character repulsed me in some way usually in some violent way. At least this book confirmed for me that characterization is absolutely central to my reading experience. If I cannot feel something for a story s characters, even beautiful writing and an evocative setting will most likely fail to move me.

"104","Wuthering Heights"," 30, 2015 Connie","it was amazing"," 4 1 2 stars.Wuthering Heights is not only a story of a passionate love between Heathcliff and Catherine. It also shows jealousy, revenge, and a longing to possess. In the late 18th Century in stormy Yorkshire, Mr Earnshaw returns from his travels with an orphan boy, Heathcliff, who he adopts. He and Catherine Earnshaw both possess dark, wild spirits as children, and eventually fall in love. He is resented by Catherine s brother, Hinley, because Mr Earnshaw seems to prefer Heathcliff to his own son.After Mr Earnshaw s death, Hinley is the master and mistreats Heathcliff, forcing him to work as a laborer. Catherine chooses Edgar Litton, a wealthy, socially prominent gentleman to marry instead of the penniless Heathcliff who also loves her. Heathcliff leaves the area and returns as a rich man, and wrecks revenge and abuse on two generations of Earnshaws and Littons. We see upper class people lose their money, and poor Heathcliff becomes a wealthy landowner. Victims become victimizers, and abusers become the abused. But the wild and passionate Heathcliff and Catherine both need each other to feel whole and complete. Even after her death, Catherine s spirit cannot rest. The demonic Heathcliff will not feel whole until he is united with Catherine in death.The servant Nelly tells the tragic story of the family to a tenant, Lockwood, and he incorporates it into his diary with his own observations. Bronte s use of two unreliable narrators Nelly and Lockwood makes one wonder about the truth of the story. The flashbacks keep the reader in suspense. The atmosphere is very Gothic and sometimes gets a bit melodramatic. The characters are haunting and tragic.Although she was an isolated daughter of a minister, Emily Bront must have been a keen observer of human nature. Like characters in Wuthering Heights, members of Bronte s family died of consumption and her brother turned to alcohol and drugs. She also lived on the wild moors of Yorkshire, the setting of the novel. During her lifetime the Industrial Revolution was causing changes in social classes, a theme which also runs through the book. The world lost a great British writer when thirty year old Emily Bront died in 1848. "
"105","Wuthering Heights"," 22, 2013 Christopher","it was amazing"," Last night I read the last line of this book. I shut it, set it on the nightstand. I switched off the lamp, pulled the covers over me and closed my lids.I woke in the middle of the night during a summer storm. Lightning intermittently set my bedroom aglow and at the foot of my bed I saw the outline of a man. A large man with a mop of hair messily piled onto one side of his head. Paralyzed with fear, I lay there helplessly and heard these words from the specter emitted in a gravelly and woeful tone ...is with me always in every form drives me mad She left me in this abyss, where I cannot find her Oh, God it is unutterable I cannot die without my life I cannot die without my soul Catherine My....... and the specter faded back into oblivion.No, not oblivion, for in oblivion there is no suffering.This morning the afterimage of Heathcliff s phantasm, shadow, daemon, apparition remains burned into my retinas, corneas, fovea, vitreous humor into whatever visual element images become burned and its speech repeats itself within my mind on a locked groove.Lockwood the faithful recording angel and his storyteller Ellen Dean must have gotten something wrong.

"106","Wuthering Heights"," 25, 2007 karenology","it was ok"," Melodramatic to the max. This novel couldn t help but be seriously, have you seen where the Bronte sisters lived Some little crappy town literally , where the streets were full of sewage and filth, in a house planted next to hundreds of rotting graves crammed into a tiny cemetery and stacked on top of each other . The only escape Emily and her sisters had were the moors, which were wild and sufficiently far enough from the town to provide clean air, free of corpses and cholera. Naturally, the girls would dream of distant, dark, mysterious figures who would come galloping over the moors and spirit the beautiful heroines away. Add in absurd plot twists and you ve got yourself an extended Kate Bush song. This is a great read when you re in high school and sufficiently wrapped up in melancholic, romanticized drama. It s a bit tedious and ridiculous as you get older, but I must guiltily admit still a little fun in parts. Oh Hareton, you puppy hanging son of a gun "

Thanks to which the world ended up saddled with the lesser Bronte s invidious intellectual equivalent of a rape fantasy and ever since girls and a good few boys of a certain disposition although rarely the consumptive one they would have wished for have had a roll call of role models, the bad boys and ghost girls, with which to populate their self abuse.

"115","Wuthering Heights"," 08, 2016 Tracey","it was amazing"," The story of Heathcliff s eternal love for Cathy and all it s consequences. His passion for Cathy fairly leaps off the pages, like a flame to kindling, a force so fiery and violent it can t be denied. It is filled with all my much loved Gothic elements, crumbling ruins, supernatural encounters, moonless nights and grotesque images. As early as chapter 3 Lockwood our narrator in part encounters the apparition of Cathy when a branch knocking at the window leads him to put his hand through the glass to seize the importunate branch instead of which, my fingers closed on the fingers of a little, ice cold hand Whether any of the supernatural elements are real or are imagined is never made clear, but Heathcliff s single minded obsession with Cathy has it s own, very real demons. I can t bring myself to hate Heathcliff, though he is a hateful character, his actions are unforgivable though to some extent understandable. He lost the only thing that ever mattered his Cathy. I m so glad I have finally read this classic, it will be on my shelf Books I m passionate about because was there ever more passion than Heathcliff had for Cathy even through to the destruction of everyone connected to her and including himself.

Probabilmente la mia indifferenza data dal fatto che sia Cathy che Heathcliff non mi hanno fatto n caldo n freddo. Non sono neppure riuscita a odiarli.

"118","Wuthering Heights"," 24, 2016 Riku Sayuj","it was amazing"," Dark are the tempests of the human heart. Emily Bront hurls a series of lightening flashes that captures the darkness and wildness of our basic emotions in their most grotesque poses. We know nothing in the whole range of our literature which presents such shocking pictures of the worst forms of humanity. Perhaps this is why the book had to endure so much backlash by outraged readers, in fact more disturbed than outraged.The illuminated scenes in ourselves are so disturbing because they are so familiar familiar but yet always hidden to ourselves, except for when Bront forces us to fleetingly accept what we really are, when our motives and true intents are laid bare. The most disturbing and familiar Devil in literature is constructed from these fragments of ourselves by Bront the Mephistopheles of Goethe and the Satan of Milton and other larger than life representations are tame pets in comparison. I m trying to settle how I shall pay Hindley back. I don t care how long I wait, if I can only do it at last. I hope he will not die before I do For shame, Heathcliff said I. It is for God to punish wicked people we should learn to forgive. No, God won t have the satisfaction that I shall, he returned.It is an unconcerned expression of raw emotions that drive the narrative. Nothing need be left unsaid, nothing is unholy here.These are truths about our own emotions that we cannot acknowledge to ourselves and want to clothe in fluffy cliched words and attitudes love, grief, anger, loyalty, shame these common emotions are in reality untamable monsters that inhabit the moors of our souls. We can never contain them and we should live in mortal dread of them. They are larger than life, elemental, they are the engines of history, and they are all that is. "
"119","Wuthering Heights"," 13, 2013 Kim","liked it"," I read this novel as a teenager and again in my twenties and on both occasions I disliked it intensely. Along with Tess of the d Urbervilles, it was the classic I most loved to hate. Last year I overcame my dislike of Tess when I listened to an audiobook version and I was keen to see whether my reaction to this novel had also mellowed with time. Listening to rather than reading books I ve not liked in the past or which I m not sure I ll like has been a good way of changing my reaction to a number of authors and their works. This particular audiobook was very capably narrated by David Timson and Janet McTeer, who do an excellent job of voicing the characters.Over seventy Goodreads friends and people I follow have reviewed and or rated Wuthering Heights. The reviews range from four and five star enthusiasm for example, see this review by Steve aka Sckenda, this one by Elizabeth, this one by Gary and this one by Jeannette to Tracey s eloquent one word two star review and Hayes equally eloquent and slightly longer one star review. This is a novel that prompts a range of opinions and some very strong reactions. So, has my opinion changed Yes, but not as much as I wanted it to. What s happened is that my strong aversion to the characters has muted into, well, indifference. I found it very difficult to care about the fate of what is possibly the most unpleasant set of characters ever to populate a novel. However, I didn t hate them. My main emotion as they played out their melodramatic life stories was irritation. I did feel occasional flashes of compassion for Hareton Earnshaw and Cathy Linton, but mostly the characters annoyed me and they occasionally made me roll my eyes. I understand that this is a story of obsession, passion, madness, hate and revenge, which means it s not going to be a sunshiny, happily ever after tale. I have no problem with that. I also have no problem with novels that feature unlikeable characters. Indeed, I love having a villain to hate. However, in terms of Victorian novels I prefer George Eliot s psychological insight, Wilkie Collins sensationalism, Elizabeth Gaskell s social realism and Thomas Hardy s tragedy to this melodramatic Gothic potboiler. If there s not going to be humour to make me laugh, then give me drama that induces compassion, tears or pity and terror rather than eye rolling irritation. I want to really feel for and about characters, both good and bad. I don t want to be indifferent to their fate.That said, I love some aspects of this novel. The complex narrative structure is one of them. The structure is comprised of two primary first person narratives folded into each other and supplemented by other first person accounts related by one of the primary narrators. This doesn t always work very well, as the voices of the female narrators tend to sound too similar. However, the complexity and ambition of the form is astounding, particularly in the work of a first time novelist. Another fascinating feature of the novel is the issue of narrator reliability. I found myself continually wondering about Nelly Dean, whose reliability as a narrator seems particularly questionable given that in the course of her narrative Nelly reveals herself to be an untrustworthy servant who lies to her employers, withholds information when it suits her to do so, manipulates situations to protect herself and constantly strives to portray herself in the best possible light to her auditor. What this work says about its author is very interesting. Where did this fantastic tale come from What inspired an apparently socially phobic, reclusive and isolated young woman in Victorian England to create these larger than life characters and this disturbing tale Maybe nothing more than having the imagination of a gifted writer and poet, but something tells me that it was more than that. So now I m keen to read Juliet Barker s biography of the Bront family, which I ve had sitting around for a couple of years. Its 1000 pages remain daunting, but I ll get to it eventually. I ve only read three Bront novels and this is my least favourite. Jane Eyre remains at the top of the list, with Villette next in line. My preference for Jane Eyre s quiet heroine and Villette s depressed one possibly says more about me than it does about the novels. A rather provocative post by Imogen Russell Williams in The Guardian s book blog section may go some way to explaining my taste in Bront novels. Clearly I m with Imogen in being a Librarian rather than a Rock Star. How to rate this If I were to rate the novel solely on how I feel about the characters and the plot, then I couldn t give it more than one or two stars. However, the truly fascinating aspects of the work attract five stars. Three stars is the best I can come up with a compromise position at the midway point between utter dislike and complete fascination. Chances are I won t be reading this novel again, but I m glad that I gave it another go. Thanks to my lovely friend Jemidar for holding my hand and reading along while I listened. ETA A few hours after posting this review, I remembered that I ve read a fourth Bront novel, Anne Bront s Agnes Grey. The fact that I d forgotten about reading it is an indication of the impact the novel had on me. I think of Agnes Grey as the dull Jane Eyre. Wuthering Heights may be annoying, but it s not dull, so maybe it s not quite at the bottom of my Bront novel appreciation scale. "
"120","Wuthering Heights"," 13, 2016 Becky","really liked it"," This book has been on my To Read list nearly just about forever. I d read at least one book by both other Bronte sisters, but for some reason, I just kept putting this one off. It s one of those books that is referenced everywhere, and usually after seeing a reference or discussion, I feel like there needs to be buffer time before I try to read it so that what I ve seen doesn t make me feel some kind of way about the book before I can see for myself what I think. Which of course means that by the time I feel like I m ready to read the book, I m also due to run into a new comment about it, thus leading me to another time out. Yeah, I m weird. We know this. So... now that I ve bit the bullet and read the damn thing, I can finally stop avoiding all Wuthering Heights discussions Woot I loved the style of the story, and the evocativeness of the descriptions and the language and the dialogue. I love the period feel, with all its inherent fevers and swoons. I love how people can just die for want of a companion or if they rise to anger or linger too long in indolence, yet the thought of dying of a broken heart is preposterous. Ahh, Victorian lit. How I do love thee. On the other hand, those very same things often took me right out of the story, because I d just get to thinking how remarkable it is that someone should recall, verbatim, every word, action, and intention of every conversation that one has been in, or overheard, or had recounted to them, either verbally or in written form, first or second or even thirdhand, over the course of 30 years. Nelly Dean is our main narrator throughout most of the story, and the level of immaculate detail in her narrative is beyond ridiculous, especially when you take into account her word for word recitation of Joseph s incomprehensible vernacular. I can barely recall conversations I had last week, and even then not word for word, yet decades later this woman can apparently recall them as though they just took place right in front of her. I understand wanting to paint the picture and show vs tell and both are done quite well here , but I m quite sure that not one person residing at Wuthering Heights or Thrushcross Grange was ever accused of brevity in their lives, and entire paragraphs of filler description were apparently needed to set the tone or scene for every conversation ever and Nelly gave every word of it right back to us via her conversations with Mr. Lockwood. Perhaps she has a photographic memory, but it just seems so ridiculous to have that level of recall for conversations that most would dismiss almost instantly as being unimportant. Do I need to know that the fog was a misty gray instead of a milky white I guess I did. Simply saying that there was fog isn t quite good enough.It makes me wish that a different narrative structure was employed for this book, because this was all just so unbelievable to me, and I kept constantly being pulled out of the story whenever I d recall that Nelly is the one telling Mr. Lockwood every word of it. He lapped it up, but I just kept wishing she d give us the Reader s Digest Condensed version. It would be more believable to me, at any rate. Anyway, that was my biggest pet peeve about this book. When I forgot that Nelly was remembering and relaying all of this, and just allowed myself to get caught up in the story, it was quite good. I m still not sure that I really get it, I ll be the first to admit that, but I did feel for the characters, even if I didn t particularly like them, and so to me this book was a success. I like messed up characters, and this book was stuffed to the gills with them. There was one point about the midway point through this book that I felt like Heathcliff and Catherine s dysfunctional kind of love may have formed the inspiration behind Gillian Flynn s book Gone Girl. If ever two fucked up people deserved each other more before there was a Nick and Amy, it would have been Heathcliff and Catherine. I can t say that I would call this book romantic, but it is a romance, of sorts. It s just that theirs is a hurricane of savage selfishness and vindictiveness and hurt, with Heathcliff and Catherine at the center, whipping around each other and letting the damage spin out to affect everything and everyone else that it touches. Thankfully, that circle is relatively small just two families and a small number of servants caught up in the drama, but the wreckage is no less violent for all that it s mostly self contained. Honestly, I can t say just quite what it is that I liked about this book, but I did like it. I don t think it s a favorite, or one that I would re read very often, but I enjoyed being caught up in the circle of their drama and was curious to see where it would go and what would happen. I also quite liked the reader for the audiobook edition that I listened to. There are over a dozen different versions of this book on audio alone, and I sampled most of the unabridged ones before I settled on the one read by Magda Allani. I think that her voice had the right quality for this kind of story a little bit deep and husky, a little bit brogue, a little bit feminine. It certainly added to the experience and contributed to my being able to just settle in and listen. I definitely recommend this version of the audio if you re into that sort of thing. Though you might want to keep a copy of a print version handy for deciphering Joseph s accent. She doesn t shy away from reading it like an old toothless man who isn t exactly particular about enunciation, that s for sure "

"122","Wuthering Heights"," 30, 2014 Rusalka","did not like it"," Well. That s done. I ve been meaning to read Wuthering Heights for years. It s a Classic so along with that goes all the cultural references I have never really got . The Brontes are hailed in some circles as better than Austen. It s the most romantic story ever written. Let me address those assertions. Bullshit.Wuthering Heights is a book about the most stubborn, sullen, sulky, self centred, selfish I ve unintentionally gone to alliteration and I have now run out of s words , prideful, petulant, bad tempered, greedy, hypocritical individuals I have ever had the displeasure of reading all shoved into one book. I m at a loss of why the book has been taught in high schools around the world for years. The story isn t particularly interesting or complex. The writing and language is easy to read and understand, which possibly makes it a more accessible option. Some people may have problems with the dialect parts, but to me that was just a Yorkshire accent. I actually stopped reading it as although I could understand it, it did take a bit of brain power to switch in and out of it and most of what Joseph said was rubbish anyway. Is it taught with the lesson all these characters are who you should not grow up into Because that would make sense, a warning not to be like them.This is a book of abuse. Really, that s what it comes down to. Severe manipulation of people, with liberal sprinklings of physical, emotional, psychological, and no doubt in my mind in the background, sexual abuse. Now I am far from being a prude or easily offended. I have read many a book that deal with these issues and themes. But in most other books there is a story that turns those situations into plot devices. Wuthering Heights doesn t have this. It is a chronicle of how people wish to control and or destroy other people, mainly for the sake of it. It left me feeling a bit off in places.And for the romance. There was hardly anything. There was fighting, sulking, screaming, name calling, shunning but not romance. I knew beforehand that Heathcliff and Cathy were supposed to love each other, but I would have found it hard to see if I didn t have that context. Life is too short to have a relationship like theirs, and it definitely is too short to read about it. Positives Well, as I said it was easy to read for a classic. That s good. I will now understand cultural references made about Wuthering Heights, so I can appear more intelligent in very certain conversations. And the moors. Can t go wrong with the moors. I can frolic over the moors myself and leave Cathy and Heathcliff behind. For more reviews visit http rusalkii.blogspot.com.au "
"123","Wuthering Heights"," 14, 2016 Samra Yousuf","liked it"," If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger. Well,a good deal better than i expected it to be,but a great deal long stretched to make you curse under breath.and I really hate myself for not cherishing it as the hype and glaring reviews demands it to.and I certainly blame solely myself for it.Actually classics are playing prank with me these days.The more I try to get used to them,the more they prove unreachable.but to speak my heart there was not a thimble of crust and meat to devour or savor.A story of unrequited love and betrayal they say,but my tiny wits were quite not that highly honed to get a single wave of anything but a jumble of words and words and more words.If you Name it classic well,so be it then.I just balk by the idea of re writing the story to review it,thats not me to do.and to do that with this one Writing style,setting,Gothic elements,chunks of romance were good things and very skilfully crafted no doubt.afterall she is a Bronte...but I was in hard times to get it finished it remained lingering on till the end. Eventually, the final pages came into view and I was desperate there must be some redemption for this junk Some message, some ending sequence, SOMETHING that makes this worthwhile. The characters are so self absorbed and posses an unprecendeted lack of intelligence, yet are still portrayed as intelligent by the literary world, that it seemed like the only fitting ending would be the characters realizing their stupidity and engaging in a mass suicide. No such luck. Every last word was idiotic and as empty as the first. But you know what grinds my gears even more than the fact that I wasted a week on this worthless pseudo classic People seems to place it among the greatest novels ever written.....ahh each and every nerve and bone is aching like hell.....and to lovers of such classics MY Apologies..

"124","Wuthering Heights"," 21, 2011 Thomas","it was amazing"," Amidst exams and schoolwork it took me almost two weeks to finish this book not only because of external forces preventing me to read, but because of its strange structure. The beginning confused me to the point that I disregarded it until later on in the novel, and some of the dialogue well, Joseph s dialogue I didn t bother to read.I loved Wuthering Heights, despite its minor problems. Mainly because of the passion. Oh, how I loved the passion. Heathcliff s convoluted cunning, Catherine s crazy schemes, and how the ending brought everything back full circle it was everything a romance should be.Even though I disliked certain aspects of how the story was told, I enjoyed Nelly Dean s narrative. Emily Bronte shows her sheer genius by inventing a character that can be neutral between the houses, yet able to possess bias that didn t detract from the story itself. The cyclical structure of the book reminded me of John Steinbeck s East of Eden, another book that I loved.Leaning toward a 4.5, but because it s a classic I ll just go with a five. Not to mention that I interrupted a conversation with my friend after reading a certain chapter of this book to scream the passion the passion in a mock psychotic voice.Want to read more of my reviews Follow me here.

I am still upset the I wasted the time reading about 2 miserable people who instead of just being miserable together, ruin a bunch of other people s lives in the process. The only reason I even finished it was that I thought it had to get better since everyone raves about what a wonderful romantic novel it is. There was no romance but plenty of pride, malice, contempt to name a few . If this was the state of my romantic life I would have hurled myself off the moors. "

"127","Wuthering Heights"," 16, 2015 Anne","liked it"," This book drove me insane. It was such a wild, tumultuous roller coaster of rollicking emotions that I am left here at the end with an odd sense that my life is missing some drama . That, and the reassurance that if at some point during my existence I feared I did not have all my reason, there is now no doubt at all that there is nothing the matter with me or my senses. I am perfectly sane. Or I was, until I read this. Part of me hates this book to its very core. My half that has a penchant for all things sweet, romantic and sunny, and who delights in gentle romances where the characters do nothing but sip afternoon tea, exchange witty remarks and go to balls in extravagant clothing, highly disliked this novel. There was so much bitterness. So much hate. So much corruption. So much misery. Almost all the characters are detestable. The hero , Heathcliff, is anything but a hero, and I don t think anyone could sincerely read this book and think Wow. I want a love story like Catherine and Heathcliff . Their love for each other only served to drive them mad, as well as me and every other character in the story. I don t think I shall ever understand why Heathcliff never fought for Catherine while there was time, and persuade her to marry him instead of Edgar Linton, instead of running away and staying God knows where for three whole years a fact which my practical self strongly disliked, since it made no sense and what he did during that time is never explained . It s beyond me. Catherine was an absolute madcap, and she was so passionate, wicked and horrible that I could not stand her one minute. view spoiler I was never gladder of a character s death than I was of hers hide spoiler I was strongly tempted to stop reading this half way through, because there was so much madness and violence and the whole story seemed to make no sense at all. It was horrible, and picking it up every evening to continue was a pain. I felt like I was losing brain cells. Be with me always take any form drive me mad only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you Oh, God it is unutterable I can not live without my life I can not live without my soul It s like this the whole time...good, in a way, but So. Crazy However I persevered, and once a few of the characters were out of the picture, it became a lot more bearable, and I actually enjoyed, to some extent, the latter half of this book. I preferred the second generation of characters much more than the first. That s where the second part of me, my more liberal minded half who can recognize and appreciate greatness, admits that Wuthering Heights does indeed have its merits. For one thing, Emily Bront write some passages about love that, if taken out of context, are truly beautiful. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same. This will always be one of my favourite quotes.The story is definitely poignant, and although Heathcliff was undoubtedly awful, she still succeeded in making me feel sorry for him by turns, before he d go off and do something horrible again. I recognize Bronte s genius and talents, and her ability to explore and examine the sufferings of the mind and heart, and the consequences of letting hate and revenge empower one. I did not find it enjoyable to read about it and squirmed each time Heathcliff or Hindley would hit someone , but it was a great book, in the sense that I found it very awe inspiring and powerful, but also horrid, shocking and awful at the same time.My emotions towards this book feel like the book itself tempestuous, torn, indecisive and stormy.Whether you love Wuthering Heights or not, I can guarantee it will make you feel strong emotions. This is definitely not a light, romantic book. It s a wild, all consuming and completely insane story. I have not broken your heart you have broken it and in breaking it, you have broken mine.

"128","Wuthering Heights"," 27, 2012 Jonathan","liked it"," This was a tale not of passion as much as obsession. Compared to other great classic romances this was no Pride and Prejudice in my eyes. I may prefer the fact that the prose of Emily Bront is more obviously passionate than that of Austen s but in terms of storyline, plot and characters Austen wins the battle easily for me.It was difficult to really like this novel. It was well devised, well plotted and well written but the characters were incredibly unlikeable. The men were all either brutes, simpletons or first class dandies and the women were either overly domineering manipulators or they tended to be cruel and spoiled. Only the narrator s appeared to possess any decent qualities and since this was not a didactic narrative such as The Great Gatsby I found it hard to enjoy a novel full of such selfish and spiteful characters. Personally I cannot enjoy a tragedy unless in the beginning the characters were likeable to begin with. When a tragedy like this exists I personally as the reader find myself cheering at the end the fact that it finally finished and the characters got the unhappy ending they deserved. It may sound cruel or callous of me but remember these are fictional characters and when they re created to be more shallow than any human being I just don t care enough about them.I once heard Heathcliff described as more smouldering and dashing than Mr Darcy. However the only thing I saw in Heathcliff was a devilish and beastly man view spoiler who ultimately killed Cathy. How is he meant to be a romantic hero when he killed the woman he loved The tale to me reads more that Heathcliff killed the one woman he lusted after. hide spoiler At least Mr Darcy did everything out of noble reasons. Heathcliff possessed no such nobility in my mind. I would even compare Cathy to Elizabeth Bennett. Elizabeth is a smart and self assured protagonist while Cathy must have been on the edge of insanity. She was capricious, conniving and vampiric. She was virtually dependent on the men around her to survive and she used them like a leech. I would have felt sorry for those men if Edgar wasn t such a baby and Heathcliff were not a devil.Ultimately this wasn t a tale of passion and romance as much as a study of insanity and obsession. And as such it became difficult to enjoy watching the tragic shortcomings and failings of men and women possessed and cursed by their own failings. Although to be fair the story does end with a redemptive quality. view spoiler But who s to say that that final relationship between Cathy and Hareton would survive hide spoiler "

Reading the book I m completely befuddled as to how I ever came away with that impression...unless of course the film is totally different from the novel.None of the characters are really sympathetic, and some are so irritatingly antagonistic towards eachother and completely unfounded prejudices handled without the slightest trace of Austen s humor that I found myself rooting for the complete destruction of Wuthering Hieghts the grange and everyone remotely associated with them both.

"136","Wuthering Heights"," 23, 2008 Jody","it was amazing"," Published in 1847, WUTHERING HEIGHTS was not well received by the reading public, many of whom condemned it as sordid, vulgar, and unnatural and author Emily Bronte went to her grave in 1848 believing that her only novel was a failure. It was not until 1850, when WUTHERING HEIGHTS received a second printing with an introduction by Emily s sister Charlotte, that it attracted a wide readership. And from that point the reputation of the book has never looked back. Today it is widely recognized as one of the great novels of English literature. Even so, WUTHERING HEIGHTS continues to divide readers. It is not a pretty love story rather, it is swirling tale of largely unlikeable people caught up in obsessive love that turns to dark madness. It is cruel, violent, dark and brooding, and many people find it extremely unpleasant. And yet it possesses a grandeur of language and design, a sense of tremendous pity and great loss that sets it apart from virtually every other novel written. The novel is told in the form of an extended flashback. After a visit to his strange landlord, a newcomer to the area desires to know the history of the family which he receives from Nelly Deans, a servant who introduces us to the Earnshaw family who once resided in the house known as Wuthering Heights. It was once a cheerful place, but Old Earnshaw adopted a Gipsy child who he named Heathcliff. And Catherine, daughter of the house, found in him the perfect companion wild, rude, and as proud and cruel as she. But although Catherine loves him, even recognizes him as her soulmate, she cannot lower herself to marry so far below her social station. She instead marries another, and in so doing sets in motion an obsession that will destroy them all. WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a bit difficult to get into the opening chapters are so dark in their portrait of the end result of this obsessive love that they are somewhat off putting. But they feed into the flow of the work in a remarkable way, setting the stage for one of the most remarkable structures in all of literature, a story that circles upon itself in a series of repetitions as it plays out across two generations. Catherine and Heathcliff are equally remarkable, both vicious and cruel, and yet never able to shed their impossible love no matter how brutally one may wound the other. As the novel coils further into alcoholism, seduction, and one of the most elaborately imagined plans of revenge it gathers into a ghostly tone Heathcliff, driven to madness by a woman who is not there but who seems reflected in every part of his world dragging her corpse from the grave, hearing her calling to him from the moors, escalating his brutality not for the sake of brutality but so that her memory will never fade, so that she may never leave his mind until death itself. Yes, this is madness, insanity, and there is no peace this side of the grave or even beyond. It is a stunning novel, frightening, inexorable, unsettling, filled with unbridled passion that makes one cringe. Even if you do not like it, you should read it at least once and those who do like it will return to it again and again. "

It took me three days to read it, although, I can t say that I had much free time but still tried to use every free minute to read. The novel captured me from the first page and I simply couldn t put the book down. Maybe, the fact that I decided to read a book in Russian for a change made such an effect and impressed me so. I really started missing the beauty of my native language in books.Emily Bronte created the inimitable gloomy atmosphere with the help I ve just finished Wuthering Heights . It took me three days to read it, although, I can t say that I had much free time but still tried to use every free minute to read. The novel captured me from the first page and I simply couldn t put the book down. Maybe, the fact that I decided to read a book in Russian for a change made such an effect and impressed me so. I really started missing the beauty of my native language in books.Emily Bronte created the inimitable gloomy atmosphere with the help of descriptions of nature and personifications of it. The author coped with the goal perfectly. The dreary feeling of something supernatural never left me while reading.The theme of love is the main theme of the novel. In my opinion, love should make people kind and caring and not only towards the person you are in love with, but towards the whole world. But love is different, it can inspire to share happiness with other people and it can inspire to avenge. But it doesn t mean that Heathcliff s love for Catherine wasn t right or proper . That love was the strongest feeling he was able to share. Of course, his own way of loving is incomprehensible for normal people. The love story between two main characters was disconsolate and, nevertheless, I was glad to read an unusual love story.This was the second gothic novel that I ve read and I m totally in love with this genre Although, the book made me shiver with fear a few times, I m delighted with the way Heathcliff loved Cathy even when he acted like a beast. Such behaviour only emphasized his crazy demonic passion for Catherine. The theme of suffering is one of the main themes of the novel. All the characters suffered mentally or physically. And sometimes it seemed to me that Heathcliff enjoyed suffering.Heathcliff s character is attractive to me because I find it unpredictable and mysterious. After Catherine s death the revenge became the sense of his life and that made the plot interesting. Catherine and Heathcliff will remain in my memory as phantoms that haunt the moors forever. I had no doubt that Catherine s soul was always near Heathcliff and she finally took him away with her.Little Cathy and Hareton reminded Heathcliff about his relationship with the love of his life. Let me dream, that Cathy and Hareton lived happily together.In conclusion I d like to say that I m glad to discover a new genre of literature for me. "
"138","Wuthering Heights"," 28, 2016 Meags","liked it"," 2.5 StarsThat was unexpected. I guess I always assumed this classic was another all embracing, Austen esque type love story. I assumed there d be an intelligent and sassy heroine, who would ultimately get swept off her feet by a dashing, but reticent, male lead. I assumed there d be plenty of swoon worthy romantic gestures, and an eventual and earned happily ever after for the main couple.Boy, was I wrong. This was one despairing turn of events after another, and to be honest, I m not sure if there was a likeable character to be seen. view spoiler Although, I did have a soft spot for dear Hareton especially while he was being bullied by young Linton and young Catherine the snobbish asshats hide spoiler .

The whole disliking characters thing is where I struggle I really have trouble appreciating a story, regardless of how well it was written, when I despise everyone involved. It leads to a bit of a disconnect for me. However, I can still appreciate the complexities of Bronte s storytelling, considering both how young she was when she wrote this and the time period in which it was written. Gotta give props to her for that "

"140","Wuthering Heights"," 28, 2013 K.M. Weiland","it was amazing"," It is easy to understand why Emily Bront s first and only novel was ill received upon its first publication. Perhaps the ultimate Gothic novel, Wuthering Heights is a far cry from the simple tale of ill starred lovers one might expect from the pen of a Bront . Dark, sordid, even vulgar at times, the story of anti hero Heathcliff a gypsy child adopted, but never accepted, by the Earnshaw family of Wuthering Heights teems with all the basest passions of mankind.Befriended only by the younger Earnshaw child, a girl named Catherine, Heathcliff grows to hate all those who dare tread upon him because of his low birth. He grows obsessively attached to the beautiful, wild spirited Catherine, and when her pride forces her to marry another rather than stoop to Heathcliff s own station in life, he begins plotting the grand revenge that will send all of them to their graves.Few if any likable characters populate this book. It is a tale of love, but it is not an uplifting tale. It is a story of cruelty, selfish passion, vengeance, and finally madness. Despite its depressing theme, however, Bront s exceptional writing raises it to the deservedly lofty height of a classic.Told mostly through the first person narration of housekeeper Ellen Dean, the story progresses through Heathcliff s tormented childhood, Catherine s marriage to Edgar Linton, Heathcliff s elaborate revenge against the child of Catherine and Edgar s marriage, and finally his strange departure from the world of the Heights.

"141","Wuthering Heights"," 11, 2012 Amber Todoroff","did not like it"," I m curious to know if ever there were an another terrible book that had more heaps of undeserving praise. Several people have recommended this book to me, purporting it to be their absolute favorite. It leads me to question my friendship with them and if, indeed, they have ever read any other book. ANY. Other book. This book s plot is incredibly fatiguing. It is touted as a great, tragic romance. I spied no romance and the tragedy that I was supposed to feel for some of the character s deaths was smothered by my over all happiness that I would not have to read about them any more. Indeed, the biggest tragedy of all was the loss of those precious minutes I spent of my limited time on earth reading this absolute garbage. The only thing I gained was an immediate disdain for people listing this book among their favorites. If you are ever curious as to someone s intelligence or devotion when they tell you they love books, ask them how they feel about Wuthering Heights. If they say a word of positive, do yourself a favor and avoid them forever. There are many, many wonderful novels from the 19th century. This is not one of them. "

This is the first piece of classic literature that I decided to pick up completely on my own actually finish that I didn t have to struggle through. I can definitely say I was rarely ever bored with this one I did enjoy reading it...but it is not at all a favorite.The characters were so detestable, and their actions are repulsive 90 of the time causing me to spend the entirety of this book being angry with at least one of them.

"148","Wuthering Heights"," 06, 2016 Tamsien West Babbling Books","it was amazing"," An engrossing tale of revenge, malice, pride and the corruption of love. I was unexpectedly entranced by this classic novel that I had avoided for so many years, especially as it so thoroughly scuppered all of my pre conceived notions about the plot. This is not a romantic tale of love and lust with a happily ever after, it is a bitter and twisted story of all the worst ways humans can corrupt emotions. And I loved it.I found all the characters in Wuthering Heights to be wicked or contemptible in some way. Even Nelly, the sometimes narrator and maid, who could have been portrayed as a kindly, sympathetic character is responsible for treating other characters awfully. To me though this was all part of the appeal It sounds strange to enjoy a book so much where you can t possibly like a single character, but there is something so wonderfully invigorating about reading a novel where the author has so deliberately set out to expose all the worse parts of humanity. I feel like many people will be torn between hatred of the characters and being impressed with the literary merit of the story. For me, I don t mind that all of the characters are awful, I think it just shows a writer who was so determined to write either what she saw of the world, or what she saw that was missing from novels in her time. By the end though I came to be sympathetic towards Hareton, so I guess he is the redemption of the novel.One of the most fascinating elements of Wuthering Heights is the connections between everything in the story. There are pairs everywhere you look, and the story echoes itself over and over again. There are two Catherines, two Heathcliffs, two houses Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights , two families Earnshaw and Linton , two generations of characters, and even two halves to the novel. I found the names endlessly confusing, and on the advice from someone on instagram looked up a family tree. After shouting that the English should stop marrying their cousins, I did stop and think about the significance of all these pairs and of how interlinked all the elements of the story are. All these sets of pairs give the novel a claustrophobic feeling, and drive the tension in the inter personal dramas. The only character to ever leave the limited setting of Grange and Heights dies off screen once again adding to the possessive hold that novel has on physical space. I was also fascinated by how the second generation echoes the personality and failings of the first generation, which gave the novel a poetic feeling. My favourite quote and there were many throughout has to be I have not broken your heart you have broken it and in breaking it, you have broken mine. As it just so perfectly illustrates the circular nature of the story and the excess of emotion that it contains.In terms of the excess of emotion, Heathcliff seems to be widely regarded as a classic example of the tortured romantic hero archetype. I m honestly not sure that I agree with that assessment, though I can appreciate that his twisted love is a particular form of romance, perhaps something we could call gothic romance. He is fascinating as a character, being so deeply invested in long term revenge even after the death of those who inflicted pain upon him , but I didn t find him to be a romantic character.I am very glad I read this book. It is one that I have heard mentioned and referred to so many times, but I didn t imagine that it was such a dark and complex book. The more I think about it the more clever this book appears to be. Emily Bronte might have only written one novel, but it is certainly a fascinating one.Suitable for readers aged 16 and up, but probably of more interest to older readers. "
"149","Wuthering Heights"," 18, 2013 Tempo de Ler","it was amazing"," Magn fico Grandioso Solene nico. sempre t o bom encontrar um preferido Ler O Monte dos Vendavais foi, para mim, uma experi ncia arrebatadora. O seu poderoso fasc nio teve in cio logo desde o come o do livro quando, tal como Lockwood, visitei pela primeira vez a casa do Monte dos Vendavais o seu ambiente hostil, sombrio e taciturno t o magnificamente descrito, a intrigante sensa o de maldade inata... uma atmosfera quase virulenta na sua lugubridade e permaneceu at ao final, quando a aproxima o s personagens nos traz a compreens o de que n o h ali verdadeiros vil es, mas sim uma s rie de v timas v timas das conven es sociais, dos ideais alheios e das falhas do seu pr prio car cter.A narra o, a cargo da perspicaz governanta Ellen Dean que n o s interpreta mas tamb m interfere na hist ria, sincera e melanc lica mas ao mesmo tempo apaixonada e completamente apaixonante. Ao lidar com as insensatas e perversas raivas alheias, com os in quos caprichos dos outros, Ellen traz nos um relato tormentoso que exp e como o amor pode ser, tamb m ele, uma for a destruidora quando o car cter dos apaixonados pende para o ci me, para a hipocrisia e para a vingan a uma vez confrontados com a incapacidade de possuir o que mais almejam O perigo de ver em outro algu m todo o sentido da vida. Diversos elementos se re nem com rara per cia para transformar O Monte dos Vendavais numa obra prima da literatura. A Natureza, personificada, torna a hist ria selvagem. A quase sempre presente aridez do clima, gra as aos ventos gelados do Norte, parece influenciar ou ser influenciada pelas circunst ncias de vida das personagens. O isolamento em que vivem estas duas fam lias, os Earnshaw e os Linton, tornam as consequ ncias ainda mais profundas e dram ticas. O sobrenatural converte o livro em algo m stico e contemplativo. Tudo isto converge para nos oferecer sensa es de sufoco, como o, tristeza e raiva at que uma derrota, que n o o chega a ser totalmente, conduz t o desejada liberta o final.Heathcliff porque imposs vel n o falar nele das personagens mais intensas que conheci vil, louco, avarento, quezilento, violento e feroz. Vive atormentado por uma c lera sufocante, sem perceber que ao ser respons vel pela infelicidade dos outros s poder estar a prolongar e a piorar a sua, matando a sua sede de vingan a nos inocentes. Sofrido e apostado em fazer sofrer, Heathcliff testemunha que amor e dio em r cios semelhantes s o o suficiente para fazer implodir um cora o, dando morte espa o para exercer a sua sedu o. O Monte dos Vendavais absolutamente inolvid vel e a viol ncia com que me entrou no entendimento, a sua agudeza e impetuosidade, a tristeza que me fez chegar pela contempla o de oportunidades perdidas e felicidades adiadas, at esperan a e nimo que se abeiram no desfecho v o manter este livro e as suas afligidas personagens muito, muito perto do meu cora o durante muito, muito tempo E preferia ser condenada resid ncia permanente nas regi es do Inferno, a voltar a passar, uma s noite, que fosse, sob o tecto do Monte dos Vendavais.

"156","Wuthering Heights"," 02, 2016 Carol Rodr guez","it was amazing"," Relectura 02 09 2016Le tengo un cari o especial a Cumbres Borrascosas porque fue el primer cl sico que le en mi vida y me abri las puertas a todas las posibilidades y grandes historias que ofrece la literatura del siglo XIX, mi favorita. Corr a el a o 1999 y ya en ese momento me impact . Pero no nos equivoquemos no me impact porque la mayor a de personajes est n medio locos o locos del todo , ni porque haya violencia o sea todo tan pasional en ese sentido soy muy dif cil de impresionar. Me impact porque me di cuenta de que aquello que ten a entre mis manos era Literatura con may sculas, porque tiene una atm sfera m s que envolvente, porque est escrito con brillantez y porque la autora hizo una historia que tiene de todo, y tan solo con unos pocos personajes, dos casas rurales y seis kil metros de distancia.Hoy en d a, tantos a os despu s, me sigue impactando, me sigo perdiendo entre sus p ginas y la descripci n de los p ramos neblinosos, la mirada de Heathcliff o la locura de Catherine, me transportan del todo a Cumbres Borrascosas. Este es el t pico libro hacia el que hay opiniones para todos los gustos, y reconozco que es un libro pausado, rico en detalles, que avanza despacito, y que dependiendo del lector puede resultar traum tico a causa del car cter de los personajes, pero para m es un libro perfecto. Es audaz, es controvertido, es... diferente. Es una historia de amor, pero de amor ef mero, desgarrado y frustrado, as que sobre todo es, en realidad, una historia de venganza fr a llevada a los l mites de la crueldad.Los personajes me encantan. Todos. Desde los Linton, Catherine que lleva mucho de autobiograf a de Emily Bront , hasta la segunda generaci n, pasando por esa gran narradora que es la se ora Dean, el devoto Joseph y, por supuesto, Heathcliff. l es la personificaci n de esa venganza que comentaba, es el ejecutor. Su alma es oscura, es un ser que ha sufrido constantes desprecios, que siempre se ha visto degradado, y cuya pasi n, reconocida cuando ya es muy tarde, le lleva a la locura junto al objeto de su obsesi n. Es el villano por excelencia, un maltratador f sico y psicol gico y un loco, pero al mismo tiempo es uno de los grandes de la literatura, y su construcci n y modelaje son impecables es pico, legendario y el detonante e hilo conductor de todas las desgracias que se suceden en esta novela. Nada habr a sido igual en la literatura universal sin Heathcliff, y eso es algo que no se puede negar. S que hay mucha gente que se siente inc moda con este personaje, pero desde mi punto de vista, est tan bien llevado que, aunque no comparta su forma de actuar es, de entre todos, mi personaje favorito de Cumbres Borrascosas.En cuanto a la ambientaci n, es otro punto a favor. Es dif cil no visualizar los parajes, las estancias o el aspecto de los personajes conforme los describe Emily Bront , ya que lo hace, a mi parecer, perfectamente. Toda la novela tiene un aire opresivo, tanto en el paisaje como por la actitud y medidas de Heathcliff. Como lectora te acabas sintiendo una prisionera m s de su voluntad, atrapada en Cumbres Borrascosas. Y todo esto es gracias a la forma en que la autora expone los hechos.Cumbres Borrascosas es el cl sico entre los cl sicos, una novela que siempre es capaz de atraparme entre lo pausado y reflexivo de sus p ginas, y en la que deseo perderme de nuevo una y otra vez.Un saludo,Carol Rodr guez "

Forse pi impegnativo. Jul E impegnativo dal punto di vista linguistico o proprio come trama Fil E impegnativo perch fa male. Ha come tematica principale l amore, quindi non dovrebbe essere un tema difficile. Il problema che un amore cos feroce, cos violento, che tira fuori la parte peggiore delle persone, le spinge a odiarsi, le spinge verso la follia. Lo stile, piuttosto lento, trasmette quest amore forte, rabbioso, pieno d odio. Darcy, nonostante i suoi difetti, era facile da trovare simpatico. Heathcliff e forse piu facile odiarlo che amarlo. Anche le descrizioni sono perfette per creare questo clima. Atmosfere quasi gotiche. Vecchie dimore in pianure sconfinate. Jul Mi attira tanto devo dire, credo sia il periodo adatto.

"159","Wuthering Heights"," 15, 2016 Lavinia Zamfir","liked it"," I can t stop wondering why so many people like this book so much.I mean, it s probably a good book, but I didn t really enjoy the plot perhaps my expectations were too high from the beginning. But Wuthering Heights has its own classic beauty and everything in the book is great, except the plot characters.First of all, the characters except Nelly, the servant and Lockwood whose personality isn t so clear to me , the narrator, everybody in the book is evil and mischevious. Not a single character is likeable maybe when they were little they were a bit less evil, but nope. I like having a bond with the characters, I like understanding them, feeling sorry for them and last but not least, feeling their emotions. I tried so hard to explain Heathcliff s behaviour. Maybe the fact that his step brother, Hindley, harassed him when he was a kid had a huge impact on his personality. Maybe he was too crazy about Catherine. Maybe he was simply retarded. I tried to find so many excuses for Heathcliff, but none of them could make me feel sorry for him or like him. He was just purely evil. I didn t like the love between Heathcliff and Catherine. You could say their love was anything but romantic two bad, unpleasant characters being fond of eachother... aww how cute and sweet The one thing I thought was interesting about the story is how the Linton family was sentenced to failure just because Heathcliff happened to fall in love with Catherine. This thing explains how such a trifling thing as two teenagers so called love can influence the lives of people surrounding them Wuthering Heights has a great revenge plot, but the reasons behind it are just too childish.It wasn t a bad book, but I didn t really get something from the story. With a great amount of indulgence, I can bring myself to say that I liked the book. "

"161","Wuthering Heights"," 16, 2007 Ebrahim Khodadady","it was amazing"," The story describes the writer s intense feelings and unorthodox attitudes towards a sophisticated yet decaying society. It starts with a paternal love towards an abandoned boy whose calamity attracts a noble English man. Instead of submitting the child to a church, the man takes the boy to his house and elevates him to the level of a natural offspring and thus arouses his own biological son s jealousy. A totally unknown love develops between the boy and the sole girl of the house which is narrated in a third voice. Given the author s background and her inability to pull herself out of a circle which knows no ending to the banality of a rural life, one wonders and is fascinated, indeed, how she produces one of the most fascinating fictions ever written in English. The author reminds us that love can not be compromised with personal comfort and capricious behaviors. You can not eat your cake and have it. Although Catherine is in deep love with the originally abandoned and philanthropically adopted boy, she flirts with a wealthy boy whose social status satisfies her unexpressed need for external acceptance. Unsuccessful marriages, we are constantly reminded, ruin the lives of all parties involved. Personal feelings must be controlled and brought under noble values if life is to be shared with others. Indirectly, the author emphasizes the religious principle of staying within marital boundaries once a faithful vow is being taken. "

Still, I felt compelled to get a good 80 of the way into the edition of Wuthering Heights I was reading before I realized I was wasting good reading energy on finishing it only because it was a classic , and had no affection for the book whatsoever. So I said screw this, and just read a summary on line and added it to the pile to go back to the library.First of all, this book is told in the most boring fashion ever, all from the point of view of one servant woman. She just drones on and on, and there is so much boring detail I could vomit. And I usually like 18th 19th century British literature with detail. Secondly, the families in this book are so god awful dysfunctional and every last character so unsympathetic that I just really didn t care what happened to any of them, and I couldn t bear 20 pages at a time leading up to one more episode of people being awful to each other. I won t go any further except to say I m sure there s all sorts of depth and meaning and etc to this book I m missing and forfeited once I left the liberal arts to study medicine. But, that decision having been made years ago, I thumb my nose at literary criticism in the way of most uneducated lay people and say insert unrefined farting noise made with mouth here to Withering Heights.

To me this explains the histrionics, cruelty, structure and even the possibly supernatural Gothic elements of the book. And yet I suspect the resemblance is by accident, not design probably Emily just thought bat shit crazy, obsessive, cruel, selfish yet self destructive, vengeful fiends were two a penny in Yorkshire. Or that adopting street orphans from Liverpool was a bad idea. "

However, I enjoyed this one a great deal more especially since it wasn t a blatant Sound of Music rip off obviously, Charlotte was the plagarizing Bronte sister .This book is bananas I read it pretty recently for the first time, and it wasn t quite what I was expecting. For one thing, Heathcliff is a bit more of a Grendel type of character than a gothic Mr. Darcy, which I hadn t realized going in, and appreciated. Also, the narrative structure is totally bizarre.This book is weird, in multiple senses of the word. If you haven t read Wuthering Heights, wait until the weather gets all grim and rainy and it s dark before five, then make a night of it. I predict that you won t be able to stop speaking in over stylized mid nineteenth dialogue for about six days, much to the amusment vexation of those around you.

Normally a story comes alive for me through its characters and t was quite hard to find any to like in this one. But even so, and before I ended up really liking two of them, I was definitely invested in the story. It s both depressing and fascinating, frustrating and unforgettable. I think I ve rarely hated characters as much as I hated some of the inhabitants of Wuthering Heights, which is probably the main reason it took me so long to finish this. At times, I wanted to crawl inside this story and kill a few of its characters. But the ending I absolutely adored the ending. For me, it s hopeful and beautiful. I m probably going to be thinking about this book for a long time. "

"177","Wuthering Heights"," 05, 2012 Anne Booklady Molinarolo","it was amazing"," Wuthering Heights is a novel that people love or hate, just as Heathcliff both loves and hates Catherine. Emily Bronte has created a masterpiece with all the juicy ingredients love, hate, obsession, ghosts, and beatific wild setting the moors of Yorkshire. The novel is told in the form of an extended flashback. After a visit to his strange landlord, foppish Mr. Lockwood requests to know more about the Earnshaws, especially about Catherine after finding what seems to be her diary. And Nelly Dean, the former servant at Wuthering Heights begins her tale. Mr. Earnshaw had returned from a business trip to Liverpool with a gypsy foundling, a dark haired, handsome orphan boy. He had taken quite a fancy to the quiet, stoic boy, because he names him Heathcliff after a son who died. Catherine befriends Heathcliff instantly. They are able to communicate with each other easily. Possessing wildly creative imaginations the pair roams the moorland wilderness, where they re most at home, and becoming inseparable. But the young Earnshaw, Hindley, detests Heathcliff from the first time he laid eyes on Heathcliff. He is jealous and derides his foster brother, because Mr. Earnshaw demonstrates his preference for Heathcliff over his own blood. Hindley is sent away to school and Heathcliff is kept at Wuthering Heights by Earnshaw s side.Hindley comes into his inheritance when his father dies and seeks vicious revenge for having his rights usurped by a wretched gypsy urchin. The 12 year old Heathcliff is totally dependent on Hindley, and the young heir knows it. Even though he is now a forced field laborer and treated harshly, Heathcliff and Cathy maintain their closeness, wandering the wild North Country and sharing Catherine s studies. One night they pay a clandestine visit to Thrushcross Grange., the home of cultured, spoiled and very well behaved, young Edgar and Isabella Linton. A dog severely bites Cathy revealing that the two youngsters been hiding in the brush spying on the Lintons. Cathy is forced to stay at the Grange for several weeks to recover. Mrs. Linton becomes intent on turning wild, mischievous Cathy into a young lady. She encourages her to become a young woman with manners and actions appropriate to her social standing in society, rather than the wild, headstrong creature she is while roaming the moors with Heathcliff. By the time Catherine returns home, in elegant new clothes, she has become infatuated with Edgar Linton. Catherine s relationship with Heathcliff has deteriorated significantly, and Heathcliff knows that the only person he ever loved is lost to him.Catherine s desire for social advancement prompts her to accept Edgar s proposal. However, she does not love him. She may care for him, but her feelings are much less than what her passionate nature requires. Here and here replied Catherine, striking one hand on her forehead and the other on her breast in which ever place the soul lives. In my soul and in my heart, I m convinced I m wrong My greatest thought in living is Heathcliff. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be... Nelly, I am Heathcliff He s always, always in my mind not as a pleasure... but as my own being. Although she knows that Heathcliff is her true love, however, she cannot marry him because he has been so debased by the Lintons. It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now so he shall never know how I love him and that, not because he s handsome, Nelly, but because he s more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same and Linton s is as different as a moonbeam from lightening, or frost from fire. Heathcliff leaves Wuthering Heights a bitter man with the knowledge that if he had come from a better social class, or had wealth, Cathy would have married him. When he finally returns, years later, a self possessed, successful, wealthy man, he is obsessed with revenge, and is very adept in exacting it.Bronte s extraordinary prose is filled with powerful imagery. No doubt this is why Wuthering Heights has stood the test of time and will continue to do so "
"178","Wuthering Heights"," 11, 2011 Lissa",""," I love this book.It s not a romance.If anyone finds any of the relationships in this book romantic, I think you need to go and stick a toilet brush in your ear and clean out your brain, because there is nothing romantic about people who physically, mentally, and emotionally abuse each other for teh lulz.I love this book because it s not a romance. I love this book because the characters are all selfish and self destructive, and completely ruin the lives of those they purport to love. It s a story of two incredibly selfish people who can t just love each other but have to hurt everyone around them as well. I think the destruction they cause from their actions is really cool. They re like little hurricanes sweeping the secondary characters along for the ride. There s so much drama confined in two houses on the Yorkshire moors that it leaves me wondering why doesn t this book explode from sheer awesomeness.People seem to think Wuthering Heights is some kind of great love story about the biggest and greatest love triangle ever. That s funny, because it s obvious Cathy doesn t really love Edgar. If you want a good love triangle, read The Phantom of the Opera. This is the story of what happens when two adopted siblings fancy the fuck out of each other but can t be together because it s as bad as if they really were siblings. When Cathy chooses to marry another man for a whole bunch of really selfish reasons the main one being he is handsome Heathcliff s malevolence amps up to a whole new level and he absolves himself to destroy the lives of everyone ever connected to Cathy, including her innocent and lovestuck sister in law Isabella, Cathy nephew Hareton, Cathy s own daughter Catherine the Second, as well as Cathy s brother Hindley and her own husband Edgar. And he does it masterfully, which is what I admire. He takes complete control of absolutely everything, despite being a gypsy foundling with not much education. This man destroys generations of people and makes everyone around him miserable all because Cathy married another man.It s not like Cathy didn t love him. She did, in her own selfish way. She loved him as much as she could comprehend love. She saw through his exterior right into his soul, and still, for some reason, thought it was a good idea to marry Edgar and break Heathcliff s heart. And it s not like Heathcliff is bad because he was abused as a child he s always been bad, and Cathy was always a spoiled bitch.And Nelly Dean The narrator herself is a bitch. She takes Cathy Jr s love letters, the only source of pleasure for her, and burns them. What a cow I never realised before how much I dislike Nelly. She s way too big for her servant boots and she sticks her nose into everything. I know as a narrator she has to be there during scenes and deliver information to us but jeez A little more decorum, please There are times when eavesdropping is OK and times when it is not.Just about the only characters I do actually like are Cathy Jr and Hareton as an adult. I think their relationship is sweet, even though it starts out so disgustingly. I think Hareton is just a big teddy bear, and Cathy Jr inherited her father s sweet nature, thank God.I love how artfully the narration changes points of view. It uses Lockwood s narration, Nelly s narration within that, and letters and others speaking inside that. It s framed so beautifully, and you never get lost with who s telling the story. The book was written like forever ago and it does it better than a lot of modern day books. So Melodrama on the Yorkshire moors spread out over two generations in one house Politics and emotions and selfishness to please all Read it That is, if you re patient enough with the language. I think people who ve never attempted a classic before should probably ease in with something a little lighter. If you can decipher Shakespeare, you ll be OK. "

"180","Wuthering Heights"," 21, 2015 Fiona",""," I first came across Wuthering Heights aged fourteen, when we examined the first three chapters for gothic elements in English class. This is brilliant thought Teenage Me, so I duly got it out of the library, and curled up in my corner with it.I made it as far as the end of Part I, and to this day I have no idea what happened in it, except for a vague lingering sense that several characters needed a good smack. And between this, and a lukewarm attitude to Jane Eyre, I swore off Bront s for the foreseeable on the basis that Life s Too Short. When you re fourteen, you can make such decisions. I m sure my English teacher was terribly disappointed all I can say is I gave it a good shot. Off I went, back to Treasure Island and the collected works of Dorothy L. Sayers.Fast forward a decade, and see the traps I build for myself in the next few months I m doing rewrites on a course in Women s Literature, so of course out of the woodwork comes a procession of Bront s well, two of them. I m emphatically with Anne on this one , and now I have no excuse. I like to think I m getting a bit more tolerant in my dotage, so maybe Cathy Et Al will get a better deal from me this time around. I d like to think so. Or maybe I will grit my teeth and progress to Virginia Woolf and Willa Cather with as much speed as I can muster. I can t rate this.Is it a masterpiece Sure. Undoubtedly. It s technically brilliant, chock full of ideas, it deserves its place in the literary pantheon. In that sense, this has got to be a five star book. I d be thrilled to write any manner of essays about it.Did I enjoy it Not even slightly. Horrible people do horrible things to other horrible people, in a place that manages to be both vastly desolate and nail bitingly claustrophobic. It s unrelentingly bleak. I didn t have fun. And, mind you, I don t have to have cheerful and friendly characters to enjoy a book. I really enjoyed Morvern Callar recently, for instance. But, like a decade ago, I found Wuthering Heights infuriating.I can t quite explain exactly why. I ll think about that, and get back to you.An afterthought, because this is barely, barely a book about love who idolises Catherine Earnshaw Who wants to be her Who wants anything to do with Heathcliff There s got to be something, otherwise why am I assaulted with the idea by the popular culture narrative of Wuthering Heights That doesn t even seem to be what Emily Bronte is getting at, so I don t even know.I m reminded of one of my favourite poems, by Robert Bringhurst These Poems, She Said.I want to say, THIS NOVEL IS TERRIBLE, but it s not. It s not at all. I appreciate it I don t have to like it. "

Definitely one of my all time favorite classics. There is something so beautiful in the way that Heathcliff and Catherine love each other, despite both their horrid natures.

"186","Wuthering Heights"," 02, 2016 Carol Rodr guez","it was amazing"," Relectura 02 09 2016Le tengo un cari o especial a Cumbres Borrascosas porque fue el primer cl sico que le en mi vida y me abri las puertas a todas las posibilidades y grandes historias que ofrece la literatura del siglo XIX, mi favorita. Corr a el a o 1999 y ya en ese momento me impact . Pero no nos equivoquemos no me impact porque la mayor a de personajes est n medio locos o locos del todo , ni porque haya violencia o sea todo tan pasional en ese sentido soy muy dif cil de impresionar. Me impact porque me di cuenta de que aquello que ten a entre mis manos era Literatura con may sculas, porque tiene una atm sfera m s que envolvente, porque est escrito con brillantez y porque la autora hizo una historia que tiene de todo, y tan solo con unos pocos personajes, dos casas rurales y seis kil metros de distancia.Hoy en d a, tantos a os despu s, me sigue impactando, me sigo perdiendo entre sus p ginas y la descripci n de los p ramos neblinosos, la mirada de Heathcliff o la locura de Catherine, me transportan del todo a Cumbres Borrascosas. Este es el t pico libro hacia el que hay opiniones para todos los gustos, y reconozco que es un libro pausado, rico en detalles, que avanza despacito, y que dependiendo del lector puede resultar traum tico a causa del car cter de los personajes, pero para m es un libro perfecto. Es audaz, es controvertido, es... diferente. Es una historia de amor, pero de amor ef mero, desgarrado y frustrado, as que sobre todo es, en realidad, una historia de venganza fr a llevada a los l mites de la crueldad.Los personajes me encantan. Todos. Desde los Linton, Catherine que lleva mucho de autobiograf a de Emily Bront , hasta la segunda generaci n, pasando por esa gran narradora que es la se ora Dean, el devoto Joseph y, por supuesto, Heathcliff. l es la personificaci n de esa venganza que comentaba, es el ejecutor. Su alma es oscura, es un ser que ha sufrido constantes desprecios, que siempre se ha visto degradado, y cuya pasi n, reconocida cuando ya es muy tarde, le lleva a la locura junto al objeto de su obsesi n. Es el villano por excelencia, un maltratador f sico y psicol gico y un loco, pero al mismo tiempo es uno de los grandes de la literatura, y su construcci n y modelaje son impecables es pico, legendario y el detonante e hilo conductor de todas las desgracias que se suceden en esta novela. Nada habr a sido igual en la literatura universal sin Heathcliff, y eso es algo que no se puede negar. S que hay mucha gente que se siente inc moda con este personaje, pero desde mi punto de vista, est tan bien llevado que, aunque no comparta su forma de actuar es, de entre todos, mi personaje favorito de Cumbres Borrascosas.En cuanto a la ambientaci n, es otro punto a favor. Es dif cil no visualizar los parajes, las estancias o el aspecto de los personajes conforme los describe Emily Bront , ya que lo hace, a mi parecer, perfectamente. Toda la novela tiene un aire opresivo, tanto en el paisaje como por la actitud y medidas de Heathcliff. Como lectora te acabas sintiendo una prisionera m s de su voluntad, atrapada en Cumbres Borrascosas. Y todo esto es gracias a la forma en que la autora expone los hechos.Cumbres Borrascosas es el cl sico entre los cl sicos, una novela que siempre es capaz de atraparme entre lo pausado y reflexivo de sus p ginas, y en la que deseo perderme de nuevo una y otra vez.Un saludo,Carol Rodr guez "

"189","Wuthering Heights"," 15, 2016 Lavinia Zamfir","liked it"," I can t stop wondering why so many people like this book so much.I mean, it s probably a good book, but I didn t really enjoy the plot perhaps my expectations were too high from the beginning. But Wuthering Heights has its own classic beauty and everything in the book is great, except the plot characters.First of all, the characters except Nelly, the servant and Lockwood whose personality isn t so clear to me , the narrator, everybody in the book is evil and mischevious. Not a single character is likeable maybe when they were little they were a bit less evil, but nope. I like having a bond with the characters, I like understanding them, feeling sorry for them and last but not least, feeling their emotions. I tried so hard to explain Heathcliff s behaviour. Maybe the fact that his step brother, Hindley, harassed him when he was a kid had a huge impact on his personality. Maybe he was too crazy about Catherine. Maybe he was simply retarded. I tried to find so many excuses for Heathcliff, but none of them could make me feel sorry for him or like him. He was just purely evil. I didn t like the love between Heathcliff and Catherine. You could say their love was anything but romantic two bad, unpleasant characters being fond of eachother... aww how cute and sweet The one thing I thought was interesting about the story is how the Linton family was sentenced to failure just because Heathcliff happened to fall in love with Catherine. This thing explains how such a trifling thing as two teenagers so called love can influence the lives of people surrounding them Wuthering Heights has a great revenge plot, but the reasons behind it are just too childish.It wasn t a bad book, but I didn t really get something from the story. With a great amount of indulgence, I can bring myself to say that I liked the book. "

"191","Wuthering Heights"," 16, 2007 Ebrahim Khodadady","it was amazing"," The story describes the writer s intense feelings and unorthodox attitudes towards a sophisticated yet decaying society. It starts with a paternal love towards an abandoned boy whose calamity attracts a noble English man. Instead of submitting the child to a church, the man takes the boy to his house and elevates him to the level of a natural offspring and thus arouses his own biological son s jealousy. A totally unknown love develops between the boy and the sole girl of the house which is narrated in a third voice. Given the author s background and her inability to pull herself out of a circle which knows no ending to the banality of a rural life, one wonders and is fascinated, indeed, how she produces one of the most fascinating fictions ever written in English. The author reminds us that love can not be compromised with personal comfort and capricious behaviors. You can not eat your cake and have it. Although Catherine is in deep love with the originally abandoned and philanthropically adopted boy, she flirts with a wealthy boy whose social status satisfies her unexpressed need for external acceptance. Unsuccessful marriages, we are constantly reminded, ruin the lives of all parties involved. Personal feelings must be controlled and brought under noble values if life is to be shared with others. Indirectly, the author emphasizes the religious principle of staying within marital boundaries once a faithful vow is being taken. "

Still, I felt compelled to get a good 80 of the way into the edition of Wuthering Heights I was reading before I realized I was wasting good reading energy on finishing it only because it was a classic , and had no affection for the book whatsoever. So I said screw this, and just read a summary on line and added it to the pile to go back to the library.First of all, this book is told in the most boring fashion ever, all from the point of view of one servant woman. She just drones on and on, and there is so much boring detail I could vomit. And I usually like 18th 19th century British literature with detail. Secondly, the families in this book are so god awful dysfunctional and every last character so unsympathetic that I just really didn t care what happened to any of them, and I couldn t bear 20 pages at a time leading up to one more episode of people being awful to each other. I won t go any further except to say I m sure there s all sorts of depth and meaning and etc to this book I m missing and forfeited once I left the liberal arts to study medicine. But, that decision having been made years ago, I thumb my nose at literary criticism in the way of most uneducated lay people and say insert unrefined farting noise made with mouth here to Withering Heights.

However, I enjoyed this one a great deal more especially since it wasn t a blatant Sound of Music rip off obviously, Charlotte was the plagarizing Bronte sister .This book is bananas I read it pretty recently for the first time, and it wasn t quite what I was expecting. For one thing, Heathcliff is a bit more of a Grendel type of character than a gothic Mr. Darcy, which I hadn t realized going in, and appreciated. Also, the narrative structure is totally bizarre.This book is weird, in multiple senses of the word. If you haven t read Wuthering Heights, wait until the weather gets all grim and rainy and it s dark before five, then make a night of it.

"207","Wuthering Heights"," 05, 2012 Anne Booklady Molinarolo","it was amazing"," Wuthering Heights is a novel that people love or hate, just as Heathcliff both loves and hates Catherine. Emily Bronte has created a masterpiece with all the juicy ingredients love, hate, obsession, ghosts, and beatific wild setting the moors of Yorkshire. The novel is told in the form of an extended flashback. After a visit to his strange landlord, foppish Mr. Lockwood requests to know more about the Earnshaws, especially about Catherine after finding what seems to be her diary. And Nelly Dean, the former servant at Wuthering Heights begins her tale. Mr. Earnshaw had returned from a business trip to Liverpool with a gypsy foundling, a dark haired, handsome orphan boy. He had taken quite a fancy to the quiet, stoic boy, because he names him Heathcliff after a son who died. Catherine befriends Heathcliff instantly. They are able to communicate with each other easily. Possessing wildly creative imaginations the pair roams the moorland wilderness, where they re most at home, and becoming inseparable. But the young Earnshaw, Hindley, detests Heathcliff from the first time he laid eyes on Heathcliff. He is jealous and derides his foster brother, because Mr. Earnshaw demonstrates his preference for Heathcliff over his own blood. Hindley is sent away to school and Heathcliff is kept at Wuthering Heights by Earnshaw s side.Hindley comes into his inheritance when his father dies and seeks vicious revenge for having his rights usurped by a wretched gypsy urchin. The 12 year old Heathcliff is totally dependent on Hindley, and the young heir knows it. Even though he is now a forced field laborer and treated harshly, Heathcliff and Cathy maintain their closeness, wandering the wild North Country and sharing Catherine s studies. One night they pay a clandestine visit to Thrushcross Grange., the home of cultured, spoiled and very well behaved, young Edgar and Isabella Linton. A dog severely bites Cathy revealing that the two youngsters been hiding in the brush spying on the Lintons. Cathy is forced to stay at the Grange for several weeks to recover. Mrs. Linton becomes intent on turning wild, mischievous Cathy into a young lady. She encourages her to become a young woman with manners and actions appropriate to her social standing in society, rather than the wild, headstrong creature she is while roaming the moors with Heathcliff. By the time Catherine returns home, in elegant new clothes, she has become infatuated with Edgar Linton. Catherine s relationship with Heathcliff has deteriorated significantly, and Heathcliff knows that the only person he ever loved is lost to him.Catherine s desire for social advancement prompts her to accept Edgar s proposal. However, she does not love him. She may care for him, but her feelings are much less than what her passionate nature requires. Here and here replied Catherine, striking one hand on her forehead and the other on her breast in which ever place the soul lives. In my soul and in my heart, I m convinced I m wrong My greatest thought in living is Heathcliff. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be... Nelly, I am Heathcliff He s always, always in my mind not as a pleasure... but as my own being. Although she knows that Heathcliff is her true love, however, she cannot marry him because he has been so debased by the Lintons. It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now so he shall never know how I love him and that, not because he s handsome, Nelly, but because he s more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same and Linton s is as different as a moonbeam from lightening, or frost from fire. Heathcliff leaves Wuthering Heights a bitter man with the knowledge that if he had come from a better social class, or had wealth, Cathy would have married him. When he finally returns, years later, a self possessed, successful, wealthy man, he is obsessed with revenge, and is very adept in exacting it.Bronte s extraordinary prose is filled with powerful imagery. No doubt this is why Wuthering Heights has stood the test of time and will continue to do so "
"208","Wuthering Heights"," 11, 2011 Lissa",""," I love this book.It s not a romance.If anyone finds any of the relationships in this book romantic, I think you need to go and stick a toilet brush in your ear and clean out your brain, because there is nothing romantic about people who physically, mentally, and emotionally abuse each other for teh lulz.I love this book because it s not a romance. I love this book because the characters are all selfish and self destructive, and completely ruin the lives of those they purport to love. It s a story of two incredibly selfish people who can t just love each other but have to hurt everyone around them as well. I think the destruction they cause from their actions is really cool. They re like little hurricanes sweeping the secondary characters along for the ride. There s so much drama confined in two houses on the Yorkshire moors that it leaves me wondering why doesn t this book explode from sheer awesomeness.People seem to think Wuthering Heights is some kind of great love story about the biggest and greatest love triangle ever. That s funny, because it s obvious Cathy doesn t really love Edgar. If you want a good love triangle, read The Phantom of the Opera. This is the story of what happens when two adopted siblings fancy the fuck out of each other but can t be together because it s as bad as if they really were siblings. When Cathy chooses to marry another man for a whole bunch of really selfish reasons the main one being he is handsome Heathcliff s malevolence amps up to a whole new level and he absolves himself to destroy the lives of everyone ever connected to Cathy, including her innocent and lovestuck sister in law Isabella, Cathy nephew Hareton, Cathy s own daughter Catherine the Second, as well as Cathy s brother Hindley and her own husband Edgar. And he does it masterfully, which is what I admire. He takes complete control of absolutely everything, despite being a gypsy foundling with not much education. This man destroys generations of people and makes everyone around him miserable all because Cathy married another man.It s not like Cathy didn t love him. She did, in her own selfish way. She loved him as much as she could comprehend love. She saw through his exterior right into his soul, and still, for some reason, thought it was a good idea to marry Edgar and break Heathcliff s heart. And it s not like Heathcliff is bad because he was abused as a child he s always been bad, and Cathy was always a spoiled bitch.And Nelly Dean The narrator herself is a bitch. She takes Cathy Jr s love letters, the only source of pleasure for her, and burns them. What a cow I never realised before how much I dislike Nelly. She s way too big for her servant boots and she sticks her nose into everything. I know as a narrator she has to be there during scenes and deliver information to us but jeez A little more decorum, please There are times when eavesdropping is OK and times when it is not.Just about the only characters I do actually like are Cathy Jr and Hareton as an adult. I think their relationship is sweet, even though it starts out so disgustingly. I think Hareton is just a big teddy bear, and Cathy Jr inherited her father s sweet nature, thank God.I love how artfully the narration changes points of view. It uses Lockwood s narration, Nelly s narration within that, and letters and others speaking inside that. It s framed so beautifully, and you never get lost with who s telling the story. The book was written like forever ago and it does it better than a lot of modern day books. So Melodrama on the Yorkshire moors spread out over two generations in one house Politics and emotions and selfishness to please all Read it That is, if you re patient enough with the language. I think people who ve never attempted a classic before should probably ease in with something a little lighter. If you can decipher Shakespeare, you ll be OK. "

"210","Wuthering Heights"," 21, 2015 Fiona",""," I first came across Wuthering Heights aged fourteen, when we examined the first three chapters for gothic elements in English class. This is brilliant thought Teenage Me, so I duly got it out of the library, and curled up in my corner with it.I made it as far as the end of Part I, and to this day I have no idea what happened in it, except for a vague lingering sense that several characters needed a good smack. And between this, and a lukewarm attitude to Jane Eyre, I swore off Bront s for the foreseeable on the basis that Life s Too Short. When you re fourteen, you can make such decisions. I m sure my English teacher was terribly disappointed all I can say is I gave it a good shot. Off I went, back to Treasure Island and the collected works of Dorothy L. Sayers.Fast forward a decade, and see the traps I build for myself in the next few months I m doing rewrites on a course in Women s Literature, so of course out of the woodwork comes a procession of Bront s well, two of them. I m emphatically with Anne on this one , and now I have no excuse. I like to think I m getting a bit more tolerant in my dotage, so maybe Cathy Et Al will get a better deal from me this time around. I d like to think so. Or maybe I will grit my teeth and progress to Virginia Woolf and Willa Cather with as much speed as I can muster. I can t rate this.Is it a masterpiece Sure. Undoubtedly. It s technically brilliant, chock full of ideas, it deserves its place in the literary pantheon. In that sense, this has got to be a five star book. I d be thrilled to write any manner of essays about it.Did I enjoy it Not even slightly. Horrible people do horrible things to other horrible people, in a place that manages to be both vastly desolate and nail bitingly claustrophobic. It s unrelentingly bleak. I didn t have fun. And, mind you, I don t have to have cheerful and friendly characters to enjoy a book. I really enjoyed Morvern Callar recently, for instance. But, like a decade ago, I found Wuthering Heights infuriating.I can t quite explain exactly why. I ll think about that, and get back to you.An afterthought, because this is barely, barely a book about love who idolises Catherine Earnshaw Who wants to be her Who wants anything to do with Heathcliff There s got to be something, otherwise why am I assaulted with the idea by the popular culture narrative of Wuthering Heights That doesn t even seem to be what Emily Bronte is getting at, so I don t even know.I m reminded of one of my favourite poems, by Robert Bringhurst These Poems, She Said.I want to say, THIS NOVEL IS TERRIBLE, but it s not. It s not at all. I appreciate it I don t have to like it. "
